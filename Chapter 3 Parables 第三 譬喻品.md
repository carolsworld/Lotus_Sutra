A translation of Lotus Sutra from Chinese to English using ChatGPT  (date: 6 - 11 Feb 2023)

妙法蓮華經譬喻品第三

The Lotus Sutra, Chapter on the Parables, Chapter 3.

爾時舍利弗踊躍歡喜，

"At that time, Śāriputra was overjoyed, jumped up with delight,

即起合掌，瞻仰尊顏而白佛言：

and joined his palms in respect to the Buddha's face while saying, 

「今從世尊聞此法音，心懷勇躍，得未曾有。

'I have heard this teaching from the World-Honored One, and my heart is filled with courage and inspiration. 

所以者何？

Why is that so? 

我昔從佛聞如是法，

In the past, I heard similar teachings from the Buddha 

見諸菩薩授記作佛，而我等不豫斯事，

and saw the Bodhisattvas receive predictions of becoming a Buddha, but I did not act on them. 

甚自感傷，失於如來無量知見。

I deeply regret that I have lost out on the immeasurable knowledge and understanding of the Tathāgata. 

世尊！我常獨處山林樹下，若坐若行，

World-Honored One, I often spend time alone under trees in the mountains, sitting or walking, 

每作是念：『我等同入法性，

and always think to myself, "We are the same in regards to the nature of the Dharma. 

云何如來以小乘法而見濟度？

How is it that the Tathāgata can save people through the teachings of the Hinayana? 

是我等咎，非世尊也。

This must be our fault, not the World-Honored One's. 

所以者何？

Why is that so? 

若我等待說所因成就阿耨多羅三藐三菩提者，

If we were to explain the causes and conditions that lead to the achievement of the unsurpassed, true, complete enlightenment of the anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, 

必以大乘而得度脫。

we would do so through the Mahayana, and attain liberation. 

然我等不解方便隨宜所說，

However, we do not understand the appropriate and convenient ways of speaking, 

初聞佛法，遇便信受、思惟、取證。』

and upon hearing the teachings of the Buddha for the first time, we simply believe, think, and verify. 

世尊！我從昔來，終日竟夜每自剋責，

World-Honored One, from ancient times until now, I have always blamed and criticized myself day and night, 

而今從佛聞所未聞未曾有法，斷諸疑悔，

but today I have heard teachings that I have never heard before, and my doubts and regrets are dispelled. 

身意泰然，快得安隱。

My body and mind are at peace, and I have quickly found peace and comfort. 

今日乃知真是佛子，

Today, I know that one truly becomes a Buddha's child, 

從佛口生，從法化生，得佛法分。」

born from the mouth of the Buddha, born from the transformation of the Dharma, and obtains the teachings of the Buddha.'


爾時舍利弗欲重宣此義，而說偈言：

At that time, Śāriputra wanted to further explain this meaning and spoke the following verse:"

「我聞是法音，得所未曾有，

"I heard the teachings of the Buddha, gaining what I never had before. 

心懷大歡喜，疑網皆已除。

My heart is filled with great joy, and all doubts have been cleared.

昔來蒙佛教，不失於大乘，

I was previously shrouded in Buddhism, not deviating from the Mahayana. 

佛音甚希有，能除眾生惱，

The teachings of the Buddha are rare and precious, able to alleviate the suffering of all beings.

我已得漏盡，聞亦除憂惱。

I have exhausted my negative karma and hearing the teachings has also removed my worries and afflictions.

我處於山谷，或在林樹下，若坐若經行，常思惟是事，

Whether I am in the valley or under the trees, sitting or walking, I often think of this matter. 

嗚呼深自責，云何而自欺？

Alas, I deeply blame myself, why did I deceive myself?

我等亦佛子，同入無漏法，

We too are the children of the Buddha, entering the teachings of no-outflows. 

不能於未來，演說無上道。

But we are unable to speak of the supreme path in the future.

金色三十二，十力諸解脫，

The thirty-two marks of a great man and the ten powers of understanding, 

同共一法中，而不得此事；

all belong to the same teachings, yet I have not realized this.

八十種妙好，十八不共法，

The eighty noble qualities and the eighteen unique characteristics, 

如是等功德，而我皆已失。

such merits, but I have lost them all.

我獨經行時，見佛在大眾，

I saw the Buddha in the midst of the masses, 

名聞滿十方，廣饒益眾生。

his name and fame known in all ten directions, benefiting countless beings.

自惟失此利，我為自欺誑。

Thinking of missing such benefits, I deceive myself.

我常於日夜，每思惟是事，

Day and night I constantly think of this matter, 

欲以問世尊，為失為不失？

wishing to ask the World Honored One, did I lose or did I not lose?"

我常見世尊，稱讚諸菩薩，

I often see the World-Honored One, praising all the bodhisattvas.

以是於日夜，籌量如此事。

I ponder this day and night, contemplating these things.

今聞佛音聲，隨宜而說法，

Now, hearing the voice of the Buddha, speaking the Dharma according to my needs,

無漏難思議，令眾至道場。

The incomparable and inconceivable non-outflow, leads all to the Way's field.

我本著邪見，為諸梵志師，

I once held wrong views, following the teachers of the Brahmins,

世尊知我心，拔邪說涅槃。

But the World-Honored One knows my heart and removes my evil, speaking of nirvana.

我悉除邪見，於空法得證，

I dispel all my wrong views, attain verification in the Dharma of emptiness,

爾時心自謂，得至於滅度；

At that time, I thought I had reached extinction,

而今乃自覺，非是實滅度。

But now I am aware, it is not the true extinction.

若得作佛時，具三十二相，

If I become a Buddha, I will have the 32 marks,

天人夜叉眾，龍神等恭敬，

The gods, humans, asuras, and others in the assembly will respectfully greet me,

是時乃可謂，永盡滅無餘。

And then I can truly say that extinction is forever without residue.

佛於大眾中，說我當作佛，

The Buddha spoke in the assembly, saying that I will become a Buddha,

聞如是法音，疑悔悉已除。

Hearing such a Dharma voice, all doubts and regret are removed.

初聞佛所說，心中大驚疑，

When I first heard the Buddha's words, my heart was greatly shocked and skeptical,

將非魔作佛，惱亂我心耶？

Could it be that magic makes one a Buddha, causing confusion in my heart?

佛以種種緣、譬喻巧言說，

The Buddha spoke with various causes and clever analogies, 

其心安如海，我聞疑網斷。

and my mind became peaceful like the ocean after hearing them. 

佛說過去世，無量滅度佛，安住方便中，亦皆說是法。

He spoke of countless extinct buddhas in the past who resided in expedient means, 

現在未來佛，其數無有量，亦以諸方便，演說如是法。

and that present and future buddhas are countless and speak the Dharma in various expedient means as well. 

如今者世尊，從生及出家、得道轉法輪，亦以方便說。

The present World-Honored One has been born, became a monk, attained the Way, and turned the Dharma wheel, also speaking in expedient means. 

世尊說實道，波旬無此事，

The World-Honored One speaks of the true path, but there are no such things as waves and tempests. 

以是我定知，非是魔作佛。

Because of this, I have firmly believed that this is not the work of a demon. 

我墮疑網故，謂是魔所為，

I had fallen into a net of doubt, thinking that it was the work of a demon, 

聞佛柔軟音，深遠甚微妙，

but upon hearing the Buddha's gentle and deep voice, which is far and subtle, 

演暢清淨法。我心大歡喜，疑悔永已盡，安住實智中。

I was greatly joyous and my doubts and regrets were forever gone. 

我定當作佛，為天人所敬，

I firmly resolve to become a buddha, honored by heavenly beings and humans, 

轉無上法輪，教化諸菩薩。」

and turn the supreme Dharma wheel, teaching and transforming bodhisattvas.

爾時佛告舍利弗：

At that time, the Buddha told Shariputra: 

「吾今於天、人、沙門、婆羅門等大眾中說，

"I am now speaking in front of the great assembly of gods, humans, monks, and brahmins. 

我昔曾於二萬億佛所，

In the past, in the presence of two million Buddhas, 

為無上道故，常教化汝，

I taught you for the sake of the supreme path. 

汝亦長夜隨我受學。

You also followed me for a long time and learned from me. 

我以方便引導汝故，生我法中。

I led you with skilful means and you were born into my Dharma. 

舍利弗！我昔教汝志願佛道，

Shariputra! I taught you to aspireate to the Buddha's path in the past, 

汝今悉忘，而便自謂已得滅度。

but now you have completely forgotten and claim to have attained nirvana. 

我今還欲令汝憶念本願所行道故，

I now want to remind you of your original aspirations and your practices on the path. 

為諸聲聞說是大乘經，

I will now explain the great vehicle scripture, 

名妙法蓮華，教菩薩法，佛所護念。

called the Lotus Sutra, that teaches the bodhisattva's Dharma and is protected by the Buddha."

「舍利弗！汝於未來世，

"Shariputra! In the future, 

過無量無邊不可思議劫，

you will pass countless and immeasurable kalpas, 

供養若干千萬億佛，

making offerings to countless millions of Buddhas, 

奉持正法，

upholding the proper Dharma, 

具足菩薩所行之道，

and perfecting the path of the bodhisattva. 

當得作佛，號曰華光如來、

You will then become a Buddha and be known as the Tathagata Light of Splendor, 

應供、

One who Responds to Offerings, 

正遍知、

One who Knows the Proper Dharmas Everywhere, 

明行足、

One who Practices the Correct Path Completely, 

善逝世間解、

One who Understands the Release from the World Well, 

無上士、

One who is Supreme among Sages, 

調御丈夫、

One who Guides and Controls Heroes, 

天人師、佛、世尊。

Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, and World-Honored One. 

國名離垢，其土平正，清淨嚴飾，

Your country will be called Purity and its land will be even and pure, beautifully adorned, 

安隱豐樂，天人熾盛。

peaceful and abundant. The gods there will be flourishing. 

琉璃為地，有八交道，黃金為繩以界其側。

The ground will be made of crystal with eight intersections and surrounded by golden ropes. 

其傍各有七寶行樹，常有華菓。

There will be seven-jeweled trees surrounding it and there will always be flowers and fruit. 

華光如來亦以三乘教化眾生。

The Tathagata Light of Splendor will also teach the three vehicles to all living beings."

「舍利弗！

Sariputra! 

彼佛出時，雖非惡世，以本願故，說三乘法。

Although the Buddha who emerges is not from a bad era, he speaks the Three Vehicles Dharma due to his original vow. 

其劫名大寶莊嚴。

The name of the eon is "Great Treasure Adornment". 

何故名曰大寶莊嚴？

Why is it called "Great Treasure Adornment"? 

其國中以菩薩為大寶故。

It is because bodhisattvas are the great treasures in the country. 

彼諸菩薩，無量無邊，不可思議，

Those bodhisattvas are countless and limitless, beyond comprehension, 

算數譬喻所不能及，

and beyond the reach of numerical comparisons and illustrations. 

非佛智力無能知者。

Only those who have not attained the wisdom of the Buddha cannot know them. 

若欲行時，寶華承足。

When they wish to act, they are equipped with treasures and flowers. 

此諸菩薩，非初發意，皆久殖德本，

These bodhisattvas are not newly motivated, but have long cultivated virtue, 

於無量百千萬億佛所淨修梵行，

and through purifying and practicing virtuous actions in countless billions of buddha-fields, 

恒為諸佛之所稱歎。

they are constantly praised by all buddhas. 

常修佛慧，具大神通，

They constantly cultivate Buddha's wisdom and have great supernatural powers, 

善知一切諸法之門，

are skillful in knowing all the doors of all phenomena, 

質直無偽，

如是菩薩，充滿其國。

Such bodhisattvas fill their country.

「舍利弗！

'Sariputra! 

華光佛壽十二小劫，

The Buddha-to-be, Hwaeum, will have a lifespan of 12 minor kalpas, 

除為王子未作佛時。

excluding the time when he was still a prince before becoming a Buddha. 

其國人民，壽八小劫。

The people in his country will have a lifespan of 8 minor kalpas. 

華光如來過十二小劫，授堅滿菩薩阿耨多羅三藐三菩提記。

After 12 minor kalpas, Hwaeum will attain the firm and complete realization of anuttarasamymak samadhi and will preach the teachings of it to the bhikshus. 

告諸比丘：

He will tell the bhikshus, 

『是堅滿菩薩次當作佛，號曰華足安行多陀阿伽度、阿羅訶、三藐三佛陀，

'This firm and complete bodhisattva will be the next to become a Buddha, known as Hwaeum-foot-easy-practice-tadaka-alaka-araha-tri-mala-tri-Buddha-tathagata. 

其佛國土亦復如是。』

His buddha-realm will also be the same.'

「舍利弗！是華光佛滅度之後，

"Sariputra! After the Nirvana of the Buddha of Light, 

正法住世三十二小劫，

the true teaching will remain in the world for 32 minor kalpas, 

像法住世亦三十二小劫。」

and the image teaching will also remain for 32 minor kalpas. 

爾時世尊欲重宣此義，而說偈言：

At that time, the World-Honored One, wishing to further explain this meaning, spoke these verses:"

「舍利弗來世，成佛普智尊，

"Sariputra, in a future life, you will become Buddha named Universal Wisdom Honored One, 

號名曰華光，當度無量眾。

also known as Glowing Flowers. 

供養無數佛，具足菩薩行，

You will save countless beings and possess all the practices of a bodhisattva. 

十力等功德，證於無上道。

You will have the ten powers and other merits, and attain the highest path. 

過無量劫已，劫名大寶嚴，

After countless kalpas, the kalpa will be called the Great Treasury of Treasures, 

世界名離垢，清淨無瑕穢。

and the world will be called the Pure Land, free from all blemishes and impurities. 

以琉璃為地，金繩界其道，

The ground will be made of crystal, surrounded by a path of gold ropes. 

七寶雜色樹，常有華菓實。

Trees with various colorful gems will bear abundant fruit."

彼國諸菩薩，志念常堅固，

The bodhisattvas in that country, with unwavering determination and divine powers, 

神通波羅蜜，皆已悉具足。

have all attained full mastery. 

於無數佛所，善學菩薩道，

They study the way of the bodhisattva well in countless Buddhas' lands. 

如是等大士，華光佛所化。

Such great sages are transformed by the light of the Buddha. 

佛為王子時，棄國捨世榮，

When the Buddha was a prince, he renounced his kingdom and worldly honors, 

於最末後身，出家成佛道。

and in his final life, he left home and attained the Buddha Way. 

華光佛住世，壽十二小劫，

The Buddha lived for twelve small kalpas 

其國人民眾，壽命八小劫。

and the people of his country lived for eight small kalpas.

佛滅度之後，正法住於世，

After the Buddha's enlightenment, the true teachings remained in the world.

三十二小劫，廣度諸眾生。

During the thirty-two minor kalpas, he enlightened all living beings.

正法滅盡已，像法三十二，

When the true teachings have disappeared, the teachings in form will persist for thirty-two kalpas.

舍利廣流布，天人普供養。

Relics will spread widely, and gods and humans will make offerings.

華光佛所為，其事皆如是，

The Buddha's brilliant light is thus. These things are all like this.

其兩足聖尊，最勝無倫匹。

The revered two feet of the saint is the most supreme, incomparable.

彼即是汝身，宜應自欣慶。」

That is your own body, it is fitting to rejoice in it.

爾時四部眾，比丘、比丘尼、優婆塞、優婆夷，

At that time, the four assemblies of monastics - bhiksus, bhiksunis, laymen and laywomen, 

天、龍、夜叉、乾闥婆、阿修羅、迦樓羅、緊那羅、摩睺羅伽等大眾，

gods, dragons, asuras, gandharvas, demons, garudas, kinnaras, and mahoragas, 

見舍利弗於佛前受阿耨多羅三藐三菩提記，心大歡喜，踊躍無量，

saw Sariputra receive the Anuttarasamyaksambodhi record in front of the Buddha and were overjoyed. 

各各脫身所著上衣、以供養佛。

They all took off their upper garments and offered them to the Buddha. 

釋提桓因、梵天王等，與無數天子，

The Shakyamuni, the king of the gods, and countless celestial sons 

亦以天妙衣、天曼陀羅華、摩訶曼陀羅華等，供養於佛

also offered their celestial robes, mandalas, and other offerings to the Buddha. 

所散天衣，住虛空中，而自迴轉；

The scattered celestial robes floated in the sky and spun around, 

諸天伎樂百千萬種，於虛空中一時俱作，

and various celestial music and performances were performed at the same time in the sky. 

雨眾天華——而作是言：

It rained celestial flowers and they said, 

「佛昔於波羅㮈初轉法輪，

"The Buddha previously turned the Dharma wheel in the land of Kapilavastu, 

今乃復轉無上最大法輪。」

and now he has again turned the incomparable and supreme Dharma wheel."

爾時諸天子欲重宣此義，而說偈言：

At that time, the celestial beings wished to deeply proclaim this meaning, and spoke a verse:

「昔於波羅㮈，轉四諦法輪，

"In the past, at Bhaṇḍagama, The Four Noble Truths were turned,

分別說諸法，五眾之生滅。

Differentiating all dharmas, The arising and ceasing of the five aggregates.

今復轉最妙，無上大法輪，

Now again it turns supreme, The most excellent and great Dharma wheel,

是法甚深奧，少有能信者。

This dharma is extremely profound, And few are those who can believe.

我等從昔來，數聞世尊說，

We have heard from ancient times, The Buddha's teachings counted,

未曾聞如是，深妙之上法。

But have never heard before, Such a profound and superior Dharma.

世尊說是法，我等皆隨喜。

The Buddha speaks this Dharma, We all follow with joy.

大智舍利弗，今得受尊記，

The great sage Śāriputra, Today received the revered record,

我等亦如是，必當得作佛。

We too are the same, And will certainly attain Buddhahood.

於一切世間，最尊無有上，

In all worlds, the most honored, There is no one above,

佛道叵思議，方便隨宜說。

The Buddha's path is ineffable, conveniently taught as appropriate.

我所有福業，今世若過世，

All the good fortune I have, If I pass away in this or a future life,

及見佛功德，盡迴向佛道。」

And see the Buddha's virtues, I will entirely dedicate to the Buddha's path."

爾時舍利弗白佛言：

At that time, Shariputra said to the Buddha, 

「世尊！我今無復疑悔，

"World-Honored One! I no longer have any doubts or regrets, 

親於佛前得受阿耨多羅三藐三菩提記。

and I have personally received the assurance of the attainment of the supreme, perfect enlightenment in the presence of the Buddha. 

是諸千二百心自在者，昔住學地，

In the past, when the thousands of two hundred minds were dwelling in the place of learning, 

佛常教化言：『

the Buddha often taught and transformed them, saying, 

我法能離生老病死，究竟涅槃。』

"My Dharma can lead one to escape birth, aging, illness, and death and attain ultimate Nirvāṇa." 

是學無學人，

Those who studied and those who did not study 

亦各自以離我見及有無見等謂得涅槃；

all considered that they could attain Nirvāṇa by eliminating their views of self and the notion of existence and non-existence. 

而今於世尊前聞所未聞，

However, now, having heard what they had not heard before in the presence of the World-Honored One, 

皆墮疑惑。

they have all fallen into doubt and confusion. 

善哉，世尊！

Well done, World-Honored One! 

願為四眾說其因緣，

I respectfully request that you explain the causes and conditions for the fourfold assembly, 

令離疑悔。」

so that they may eliminate their doubts and regrets."

爾時佛告舍利弗：

At that time, the Buddha told Śāriputra, 

「我先不言：『諸佛世尊以種種因緣、譬喻言辭方便說法，皆為阿耨多羅三藐三菩提耶？』是諸所說，

"I will not say that all the teachings of the Tathāgatas, with various causes and conditions and through various similes and expressions for the sake of convenience, are all speak for the purpose of Anuttara Samyak Sambodhi.

皆為化菩薩故。

The teachings are all for the sake of transforming bodhisattvas. 

然，舍利弗！今當復以譬喻更明此義，

However, Śāriputra, I will now explain this meaning more clearly with similes, 

諸有智者以譬喻得解。

and those who have wisdom will understand it with the simile."

「舍利弗！

"Sariputra, 

若國邑聚落有大長者，其年衰邁，財富無量，多有田宅及諸僮僕。

suppose there was a city or a village with a wealthy, aging elder who had vast wealth, many fields, houses, and servants. 

其家廣大，唯有一門，多諸人眾，一百、二百乃至五百人，止住其中。

The house was vast, but there was only one entrance, with many people staying inside, from a hundred to five hundred. 

堂閣朽故，牆壁隤落，柱根腐敗，梁棟傾危，

The hall and the towers were old and decayed, the walls were ruined, the pillars were rotten, the beams were tilting, 

周匝俱時歘然火起，焚燒舍宅。

and suddenly a fire broke out all around the house, burning it down. 

長者諸子，若十、二十，或至三十，在此宅中。

The elder's children, ranging from ten to thirty, were playing inside the house. 

長者見是大火從四面起，即大驚怖，而作是念：

When the elder saw the great fire rising from all four sides, he was greatly frightened and thought,

『我雖能於此所燒之門安隱得出，

'Although I can escape safely through the burning door, 

而諸子等，於火宅內樂著嬉戲，不覺不知、不驚不怖，

my children are enjoying themselves inside the house, unaware and unafraid of the fire. 

火來逼身，苦痛切己，

When the fire is approaching them, they will suffer terribly. 

心不厭患，無求出意。』

Their hearts do not dislike the suffering, and they have no intention of leaving.'"

「舍利弗！

"Shariputra, 

是長者作是思惟：

"Then the elder thinks: 

『我身手有力，當以衣裓、若以机案，從舍出之。』

'I am strong in body and hand, I should use my clothing or something else to get out.' 

復更思惟：

He thinks further: 

『是舍唯有一門，而復狹小。諸子幼稚，未有所識，

'This house only has one small door, and my children are young and ignorant, 

戀著戲處，或當墮落，為火所燒。

clinging to their play and may fall into the fire and be burned by it. 

我當為說怖畏之事，此舍已燒，宜時疾出，

I should tell them about the fear, this house has already burned, and it is time to hurry out, 

無令為火之所燒害。』

so as not to be harmed by the fire.' 

作是念已，如所思惟，

Having these thoughts, he does as he has thought, 

具告諸子，汝等速出。

and tells his children, saying to you all: 'Hurry out!' 

父雖憐愍、善言誘喻，

Although the father is affectionate and speaks kindly, tempting them with words, 

而諸子等樂著嬉戲，不肯信受，不驚不畏，

his children still enjoy their play and do not believe, nor are they afraid, 

了無出心；

they have no intention of leaving. 

亦復不知何者是火？何者為舍？云何為失？

They do not even know what fire is, what the house is, or what loss is. 

但東西走戲，視父而已。

They just run back and forth, playing, and only look at their father."

「爾時長者即作是念：

"At that time, the elder thought, 

『此舍已為大火所燒，

'This house has been burned by a great fire, 

我及諸子若不時出，必為所焚。

and I and my children will surely be burned if we do not leave in time. 

我今當設方便，令諸子等得免斯害。』

I will now arrange a way for my children to escape harm.' 

父知諸子先心各有所好種種珍玩奇異之物，

The father knew that his children loved various kinds of toys and treasures, 

情必樂著，

and they would be happy to play with them. 

而告之言：『汝等所可玩好，希有難得，

So he said, 'You can play with the things that you love, which are rare and hard to find. 

汝若不取，後必憂悔。

If you do not take them now, you will regret it later. 

如此種種羊車、鹿車、牛車，今在門外，可以遊戲。

All kinds of sheep carts, deer carts, and ox carts are waiting outside the door for you to play with. 

汝等於此火宅、宜速出來，隨汝所欲，

You should quickly come out of this burning house and do as you please, 

皆當與汝。』

and I will give you all that you want.' 

爾時諸子聞父所說珍玩之物，適其願故，

When the children heard about the toys and treasures their father promised, they were eager and willing, 

心各勇銳，互相推排，競共馳走，爭出火宅。

and they rushed out of the fire with great courage and pushed and shoved each other in a rush. 

是時長者見諸子等安隱得出，皆於四衢道中露地而坐，

They all gathered outside the fire, and the elder saw that his children were safe and free from harm, sitting on the ground in the streets, 

無復障礙，

unencumbered and at ease, 

其心泰然，歡喜踊躍。

and they were joyful and lively. 

時諸子等各白父言：

The children then said to their father, 

『父先所許玩好之具，羊車、鹿車、牛車，

'Father, we want the toys and treasures you promised, the sheep carts, deer carts, and ox carts, 

願時賜與。』

please give them to us now.'"

「舍利弗！

"Sariputta! 

爾時長者各賜諸子等一大車，其車高廣，

At that time, the elder gave each of his sons a big cart, the cart was high and wide, 

眾寶莊校，周匝欄楯，四面懸鈴；

surrounded by precious walls and railings, with bells hanging on all sides. 

又於其上張設幰蓋，亦以珍奇雜寶而嚴飾之，

The cart was also decorated with rich and colorful treasures and adorned with beautiful ornaments. 

寶繩絞絡，垂諸華纓，重敷綩綖，安置丹枕。

The ropes were made of precious materials, adorned with flowers and adorned with fine cushions and pillows. 

駕以白牛，膚色充潔，形體姝好，有大筋力，

The cart was driven by white oxen, with pure and handsome skin, good bodies, 

行步平正，其疾如風；

and great strength, with steps that were even and brisk, like the wind. 

又多僕從而侍衛之。

There were also many servants to attend to them. 

所以者何？

Why? 

是大長者財富無量，種種諸藏悉皆充溢，

The elder was wealthy beyond measure, his various possessions were all overflowing, 

而作是念：『我財物無極，不應以下劣小車與諸子等。

and he thought, "My wealth is limitless, I shouldn't give my children a small and inferior cart. 

今此幼童，皆是吾子，愛無偏黨。

These young children are all my sons, and I love them equally. 

我有如是七寶大車，其數無量，

I have these seven-treasure carts in countless numbers, 

應當等心各各與之，不宜差別。

I should give each of them a cart with a equal heart, without discrimination. 

所以者何？

Why? 

以我此物，周給一國猶尚不匱，何況諸子！』

My wealth could supply one kingdom, let alone my sons!" 

是時諸子各乘大車，得未曾有，非本所望。

At that time, each of the sons rode the big cart and got what they never had before, beyond their expectations.

「舍利弗！於汝意云何，

"Sariputra! What is your opinion? 

是長者等與諸子珍寶大車，寧有虛妄不？」

Is it a false offering to give senior citizens and others treasures and valuable carts?"

舍利弗言：「不也，世尊！

Sariputra said: "No, World-Honored One! 

是長者但令諸子得免火難，全其軀命，非為虛妄。

The senior citizens only wish to exempt the children from danger from fire and to preserve their lives, not to make a false offering. 

何以故？

Why is that? 

若全身命，便為已得玩好之具，

If they preserve their lives, then they will be able to enjoy the good things in life, 

況復方便於彼火宅而拔濟之。

and even more so to rescue them from that fiery abode. 

世尊！

World-Honored One! 

若是長者，乃至不與最小一車，猶不虛妄。

Even if the senior citizens did not offer even the smallest cart, it would not be false. 

何以故？

Why is that? 

是長者先作是意：『我以方便令子得出。』

The senior citizens first thought: 'I will allow the children to escape.' 

以是因緣，無虛妄也。

With this intention, there is no falseness. 

何況長者自知財富無量，

How much more so when the senior citizens know that their wealth is immeasurable 

欲饒益諸子，等與大車。」

and wish to bestow benefits on the children by offering valuable carts."

佛告舍利弗：

The Buddha said to Sariputta: 

「善哉，善哉！如汝所言。

"Well done, well done! As you have said. 

舍利弗！如來亦復如是，則為一切世間之父。

Sariputta! The Tathagata (Buddha) is also like this, thus he is the father of all worlds. 

於諸怖畏、衰惱、憂患、無明闇蔽，永盡無餘，

He has completely eradicated all fears, decay, sorrow, ignorance and darkness, 

而悉成就無量知見、力、無所畏，

and has attained infinite knowledge, power and fearlessness. 

有大神力及智慧力，具足方便、智慧波羅蜜，

He has great spiritual power and wisdom, has abundant skillful means and knowledge of the Dharmaphenomena, 

大慈大悲，

is full of great compassion and loving kindness, 

常無懈惓，恒求善事，利益一切，

and is constantly diligent, seeking good deeds, benefiting all, 

而生三界朽故火宅，為度眾生生老病死、憂悲、苦惱、愚癡、闇蔽、三毒之火，教化令得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。

and releasing from the fire of old age, sickness, death, grief, suffering, ignorance, and the three poisons. 

見諸眾生為生老病死、憂悲苦惱之所燒煮，

He sees all sentient beings burning in the fire of old age, sickness, death, grief, suffering, and ignorance, 

亦以五欲財利故，受種種苦；

and also suffering in various ways due to the five desires for wealth and benefits, and due to greedy pursuit. 

又以貪著追求故，現受眾苦，後受地獄、畜生、餓鬼之苦；

They suffer present suffering and will suffer in hell, as animals, and as hungry ghosts. 

若生天上，及在人間，貧窮困苦、愛別離苦、怨憎會苦，如是等種種諸苦。

They also suffer poverty, hardship, separation from loved ones, hatred and animosity, and other such various sufferings, whether they are born in heaven or in the human world. 

眾生沒在其中，歡喜遊戲，不覺不知、不驚不怖，亦不生厭，不求解脫。

Sentient beings are immersed in it, delighting in play, not realizing, not frightened, not tired, not seeking liberation. 

於此三界火宅東西馳走，雖遭大苦，不以為患。

Despite the great suffering, they run around the three-world fire with no care.

「舍利弗！佛見此已，便作是念：

"Sariputra! The Buddha sees this and then thinks: 

『我為眾生之父，應拔其苦難，與無量無邊佛智慧樂，令其遊戲。』

"I am the father of all beings and should rescue them from their suffering and give them immeasurable and boundless Buddha wisdom and happiness, allowing them to play."

「舍利弗！如來復作是念：

"Sariputra! The Tathagata again thinks: 

『若我但以神力及智慧力，捨於方便，

"If I only used my supernatural powers and wisdom for the sake of convenience, 

為諸眾生讚如來知見、力無所畏者，眾生不能以是得度。

for the sake of all beings, praising the Tathagata's knowledge and fearlessness, beings could not be saved by that. 

所以者何？是諸眾生，未免生老病死、憂悲苦惱，

Why is that? Because these beings are inevitably subject to aging, illness, death, sorrow, suffering and worry, 

而為三界火宅所燒；

and they are burned by the three realms' infernal abodes. 

何由能解佛之智慧？』

How could they understand the Buddha's wisdom?"

「舍利弗！如彼長者，雖復身手有力而不用之，

"Sariputra! Just as a senior, although he has physical strength, but does not use it, 

但以慇懃方便勉濟諸子火宅之難，

but uses his diligence and convenience to help his children escape the difficulties of the infernal abodes, 

然後各與珍寶大車。

then each gives them treasures and great vehicles. 

如來亦復如是，雖有力、無所畏而不用之，

The Tathagata is also like this, although he has strength and fearlessness, but does not use it, 

但以智慧方便，於三界火宅拔濟眾生，

but with wisdom and convenience, rescues beings from the three realms' infernal abodes, 

為說三乘——聲聞、辟支佛、佛乘，

and speaks of the three vehicles - the Voice-Hearer Vehicle, the Pratyeka-Buddha Vehicle, and the Buddha Vehicle. 

而作是言：『汝等莫得樂住三界火宅，

He says: "You should not enjoy staying in the three realms' infernal abodes 

勿貪麁弊色聲香味觸也。

and should not be greedy for the inferior things of form, sound, scent, flavor, and touch. 

若貪著生愛，則為所燒。

If you cling to love for life, you will be burned. 

汝速出三界，當得三乘——聲聞、辟支佛、佛乘。

You should quickly escape from the three realms and obtain the three vehicles - the Voice-Hearer Vehicle, the Pratyeka-Buddha Vehicle, and the Buddha Vehicle. 

我今為汝保任此事，終不虛也。

I now guarantee this to you and will never be false. 

汝等但當勤修精進。』

You should only diligently cultivate and progress." 

如來以是方便誘進眾生，復作是言：

The Tathagata leads beings into this path with convenience and again says: 

『汝等當知此三乘法，皆是聖所稱歎，自在無繫，無所依求。

"You should know that these three vehicle teachings are all called sacred and free from bondage, and they have nothing to depend on. 

乘是三乘，以無漏根、力、覺、道、禪定、解脫、三昧等而自娛樂，便得無量安隱快樂。』

The vehicles are the three vehicles, in which they delight in immeasurable peace and happiness, due to the absence of leaky roots, strength, awareness, the path, concentration, liberation, samadhi, and so on."

「舍利弗！

"Sariputra! 

若有眾生內有智性，從佛世尊聞法信受，慇懃精進，

If there are sentient beings with intelligence, who hear the Dharma from the Buddha, with diligence and aspiration, 

欲速出三界，自求涅槃，
eager to quickly escape the three realms and seek nirvana, 

是名聲聞乘，

this is called the voice-hearer vehicle, 

如彼諸子為求羊車出於火宅；

like those children who seek a sheep cart out of the fire house; 

若有眾生從佛世尊聞法信受，慇懃精進，

If there are sentient beings who hear the Dharma from the Buddha, with diligence and aspiration, 

求自然慧，樂獨善寂，深知諸法因緣，

seeking natural wisdom, delighting in solitude and peace, deeply understanding the causes and conditions of all things, 

是名辟支佛乘，

this is called the Pratyeka-Buddha vehicle, 

如彼諸子為求鹿車出於火宅；

like those children who seek a deer cart out of the fire house; 

若有眾生從佛世尊聞法信受，勤修精進，

If there are sentient beings who hear the Dharma from the Buddha, with diligent practice and aspiration, 

求一切智、佛智、自然智、無師智，

seeking all wisdom, Buddha wisdom, natural wisdom, and wisdom without a teacher, 

如來知見、力、無所畏，愍念、安樂無量眾生，

the Tathagata's knowledge and vision, power, fearlessness, compassionate thoughts for countless sentient beings, 

利益天人，度脫一切，是名大乘，

benefit for gods and humans, deliverance from all, this is called the Great Vehicle, 

菩薩求此乘故，名為摩訶薩，

and the Bodhisattva who seeks this vehicle is called Mahasattva, 

如彼諸子為求牛車、出於火宅。

like those children who seek a bull cart out of the fire house."

「舍利弗！如彼長者，見諸子等安隱得出火宅，到無畏處，

"Sariputra! Just like that elder, upon seeing those children and others safely escaping the fire house and arriving at a place of safety, 

自惟財富無量，等以大車而賜諸子。

he himself thought that his wealth was immeasurable, and he gifted them all with a large chariot. 

如來亦復如是，為一切眾生之父，

The Buddha is also like this, he is the father of all sentient beings. 

若見無量億千眾生，

If he sees immeasurable hundreds of thousands of sentient beings, 

以佛教門出三界苦，怖畏險道，

he teaches the Buddhist path to escape the suffering of the three realms and the dangerous path, 

得涅槃樂。

and attain the bliss of nirvana."

「如來爾時便作是念：

"At that time, the Buddha thought, 

『我有無量無邊智慧、力、無畏等諸佛法藏，是諸眾生皆是我子，

'I have an infinite and boundless store of wisdom, power, and fearlessness, and all beings are my children. 

等與大乘，不令有人獨得滅度，

I grant them the teachings of the Great Vehicle, so that no one will be left to attain enlightenment alone. 

皆以如來滅度而滅度之。』

All beings will attain enlightenment through the Buddha's enlightenment.' 

是諸眾生脫三界者，悉與諸佛禪定、解脫等娛樂之具，皆是一相、一種，聖所稱歎，能生淨妙第一之樂。

The beings who are freed from the three realms will have all the joys of the concentration and liberation of the buddhas.

「舍利弗！如彼長者，初以三車誘引諸子，然後但與大車，

"Shāriputra, just as the elder initially lured the children with three carts, but then only gave them the great cart, 

寶物莊嚴，安隱第一；然彼長者無虛妄之咎。

which was adorned with treasures and had the best hiding place, the elder was not deceptive. 

如來亦復如是，無有虛妄，

The Buddha is also like this, without deception. 

初說三乘引導眾生，然後但以大乘而度脫之。

He initially taught the three vehicles to guide beings, but then only taught the Great Vehicle for their liberation. 

何以故？

Why? 

如來有無量智慧、力、無所畏諸法之藏，

The Buddha has an infinite store of wisdom, power, and fearlessness, 

能與一切眾生大乘之法，

and can grant all beings the teachings of the Great Vehicle, 

但不盡能受。

but not all beings are capable of receiving it.

「舍利弗！以是因緣，當知諸佛方便力故，

"Shāriputra, because of this reason, it should be known that the buddhas, through their skillful means, 

於一佛乘分別說三。」

differentiate into three vehicles within one Buddha vehicle."

佛欲重宣此義，而說偈言：

The Buddha then wants to emphasize this meaning, and says a verse:

「譬如長者，有一大宅，其宅久故，

"For example, there is an old mansion, its house has been old for a long time,

而復頓弊，堂舍高危，柱根摧朽，

And it has fallen into disrepair, its halls and rooms are high and dangerous, its pillars are rotten, 

梁棟傾斜，基陛隤毀，牆壁圮坼，

its beams and rafters slant, its foundations and walls are decaying, its walls are collapsing, 

泥塗褫落，覆苫亂墜，

its mud is flaking off and its roof is tumbling down, 

椽梠差脫，周障屈曲，雜穢充遍。

its surrounding walls are bending and twisting, it is full of filth.

有五百人，止住其中。

There are five hundred people living inside,

鵄梟雕鷲、烏鵲鳩鴿、蚖蛇蝮蠍、蜈蚣蚰蜒、守宮百足、狖貍鼷鼠，諸惡蟲輩，交橫馳走。

Attacked by crows, owls, eagles, pigeons, snakes, scorpions, centipedes, and all kinds of pests, running around and crossing each other.

屎尿臭處，不淨流溢，蜣蜋諸蟲，而集其上。

The place is stinking with excrement and urine. The filth flows and overflows, with maggots and other pests gathering on it. 

狐狼野干，咀嚼踐蹋，䶩齧死屍、骨肉狼藉。

Wild foxes and wolves chew and trample, while dead bodies and bones are scattered everywhere. 

由是群狗，競來搏撮，飢羸慞惶，處處求食。

Dogs compete to fight and scavenge, famished and desperate for food. 

鬪諍𪙁掣，嘊喍㘁吠，其舍恐怖，變狀如是。

They quarrel, bite, and bark, causing terror and chaos throughout the place. 

處處皆有，魑魅魍魎、夜叉惡鬼，食噉人肉。

Everywhere there are demons, evil spirits, and night-demons who feed on human flesh. 

毒蟲之屬，諸惡禽獸，孚乳產生，各自藏護。

The descendants of these venomous creatures, the evil birds and beasts, breed and hide for their protection.

夜叉競來，爭取食之，食之既飽，惡心轉熾，鬪諍之聲，甚可怖畏。

"Night demons come to compete for food, once they are full, they become evil and their fighting sounds are terrifying. 

鳩槃荼鬼，蹲踞土埵，或時離地，一尺二尺，往返遊行，縱逸嬉戲，捉狗兩足，撲令失聲，以腳加頸，怖狗自樂。

There are also ghosts who sit on the ground like the poisonous plant “tṛṇa”, sometimes they fly up to a foot or two and play around, they grab the dog by its legs, causing it to lose its voice and they use their feet to choke the neck of the dog, enjoying its fear. 

復有諸鬼，其身長大，裸形黑瘦，常住其中，發大惡聲，叫呼求食。復有諸鬼，其咽如針。

There are also other demons with large bodies, they are skinny, black and naked, they always reside there, make loud evil sounds, and call out for food. There are also other demons with sharp throats."

復有諸鬼，首如牛頭，或食人肉，或復噉狗，頭髮蓬亂，殘害凶險，

There are also demons with heads like a cow's, either eating human flesh or gnawing on dogs, their hair disheveled, their destruction and danger abounding. 

飢渴所逼，叫喚馳走。

Driven by hunger and thirst, they cry out and run around. 

夜叉餓鬼，諸惡鳥獸，飢急四向，窺看窓牖。

The hungry ghosts of the Night Spirits, along with all the evil birds and beasts, ravenously look in all directions, peering through windows.

如是諸難，恐畏無量。

Such difficulties and terrors are beyond measure. 

是朽故宅，屬于一人。

This decaying house belongs to a single person. 

其人近出，未久之間，於後舍宅，欻然火起，四面一時，其炎俱熾。

The person has recently left, but before long, the back of the house suddenly catches fire. In an instant, the flames burn brightly in all directions. 

棟梁椽柱，爆聲震裂，摧折墮落，牆壁崩倒。

The roof beams and pillars explode with a loud noise, breaking and falling. The walls collapse.

諸鬼神等，揚聲大叫。

The ghosts and gods, they make a loud roar. 

雕鷲諸鳥、鳩槃荼等，周章惶怖，不能自出。

Eagles and other birds, demon crows and lotus demon, are all in a panic and cannot escape. 

惡獸毒蟲，藏竄孔穴。

Dangerous beasts and poisonous insects, are hiding in holes and crevices. 

毘舍闍鬼，亦住其中，薄福德故，為火所逼，共相殘害，飲血噉肉。

The spirits and demons, live there as well, due to their lack of good deeds, they are forced by the fire and harm each other,
drinking blood and eating flesh. 

野干之屬，竝已前死，諸大惡獸，競來食噉，臭烟熢㶿，四面充塞。

The relatives of the dead, who have already died, the great evil beasts, come to eat together, the smoke is thick, the surroundings are filled. 

蜈蚣蚰蜒、毒蛇之類，為火所燒，爭走出穴，鳩槃荼鬼、隨取而食。

Centipedes, earthworms, and poisonous snakes, are burned by the fire, they struggle to escape from their holes, demon crows and lotus demons, follow to eat. 

又諸餓鬼，頭上火燃，飢渴熱惱，周章悶走。

The hungry ghosts, with fire burning on their heads, they are hungry and hot, they are walking in circles. 

其宅如是，甚可怖畏，毒害火災，眾難非一。

Such is the house, it is very frightening, the harm of the fire disaster, there are many difficulties, not just one.

是時宅主，在門外立，聞有人言：

At that time, the owner of the house stood outside the door and heard someone say, 

『汝諸子等，先因遊戲，來入此宅，稚小無知，歡娛樂著。』

"You children, came into this house because of your games and you are young and ignorant, enjoying yourselves." 

長者聞已，驚入火宅，方宜救濟，令無燒害。

After the elder heard this, he was frightened and entered the burning house to rescue and protect the children so they wouldn't be burned. 

告喻諸子，說眾患難，惡鬼毒蟲，

He warned the children about the various dangers, told them about the evil ghosts and poisonous insects, 

災火蔓延，眾苦次第，相續不絕。

and how the fire was spreading and causing suffering, one after another, without end.

毒蛇蚖蝮，及諸夜叉、鳩槃茶鬼，

Snakes and poisonous insects, as well as the night demons and the ghosts of birds, 

野干狐狗、雕鷲鵄梟，百足之屬，飢渴惱急，甚可怖畏。

foxes and dogs, and the insects and their kin, were all hungry and thirsty, very frightening. 

此苦難處，況復大火。

In this suffering and danger, not to mention the raging fire.

諸子無知，雖聞父誨，猶故樂著，嬉戲不已。

The children were unaware, despite their father's teachings, they still played and had fun.

是時長者，而作是念：『諸子如此，益我愁惱。

The elder then thought, 'The children are like this, causing me more worry. 

今此舍宅，無一可樂，

Now, this house is not a place of joy, but the children are still indulging and playing, 

而諸子等，耽湎嬉戲，不受我教，將為火害。』

not heeding my teachings, they will fall victim to the fire.'"

即便思惟，設諸方便，告諸子等：

He then thought of a plan and told the children: 

『我有種種，珍玩之具，妙寶好車，羊車鹿車、大牛之車，今在門外。

"I have all sorts of precious playthings and beautiful vehicles, such as sheep carts, deer carts, and large ox carts, outside the door. 


汝等出來，吾為汝等，造作此車，隨意所樂，可以遊戲。』

Come out, and I will make these vehicles for you to play with as you like."

諸子聞說，如此諸車，即時奔競，馳走而出，到於空地，離諸苦難。

When the children heard about these vehicles, they ran out to compete and rushed to the open field, away from the suffering. 

長者見子，得出火宅，住於四衢。

The elder saw his children safely out of the burning house and settled in the four directions. 

坐師子座，而自慶言：

He sat on the lion's throne and happily said, 

『我今快樂！此諸子等，生育甚難，愚小無知，而入險宅。

"I am happy now! These children, who were born with great difficulty and are young and ignorant, have escaped the dangerous house."

多諸毒蟲，魑魅可畏，大火猛炎，四面俱起。而此諸子，貪樂嬉戲。

Despite the presence of many dangerous insects and demons, and a fierce fire burning all around, the children were still playing and enjoying themselves. 

我已救之，令得脫難。是故諸人，我今快樂。』

I have saved them and rescued them from danger, which is why I am happy now. 

爾時諸子，知父安坐，皆詣父所，而白父言：

At that time, the children knew that their father was sitting safely, and they all went to their father's place and said to him:

『願賜我等，三種寶車。

'Please give us the three precious vehicles as you promised before.

如前所許：「諸子出來，當以三車，隨汝所欲。」

 "Come out and you will have three vehicles to do as you please." 
 
 今正是時，唯垂給與。』

Now is the time to fulfill that promise."

長者大富，庫藏眾多，

The elderly man is rich and wealthy, with a vast amount of wealth stored away. 

金銀琉璃、車𤦲馬腦，以眾寶物，造諸大車。

He had numerous gold, silver, crystal, and chariots and horses, as well as many precious possessions, and he built many magnificent carriages. 

莊校嚴飾，周匝欄楯，四面懸鈴，金繩交絡。

The carriages were beautifully decorated, with rails and fences that were surrounded by golden ropes, and with bells hanging from all four sides. 

真珠羅網，張施其上，金華諸瓔，處處垂下，

Pearls and crystal covered the carriages, and golden flowers and tassels hung everywhere. 

眾綵雜飾，周匝圍繞，柔軟繒纊，以為茵蓐。

Soft silks surrounded the carriages, serving as a cushion. 

上妙細㲲，價直千億，鮮白淨潔，以覆其上。

The carriages were exquisitely crafted and valued at billions of dollars. White, pure, and spotless coverings were spread over the carriages. 

有大白牛，肥壯多力，形體姝好，以駕寶車。

There were large, white, fat, and powerful oxen, with a handsome appearance, to pull the carriages.

多諸儐從，而侍衛之。

Many servants accompanied them, serving as guards. 

以是妙車，等賜諸子。諸子是時，歡喜踊躍，

The children were given these wonderful carriages and were thrilled and overjoyed. 

乘是寶車，遊於四方，嬉戲快樂，自在無礙。

They rode the carriages all around and had fun and were completely free.

告舍利弗：

Shariputra, 

『我亦如是，眾聖中尊，世間之父。
"I am like this too. I am the most honored among all the saints, the father of the world. 

一切眾生，皆是吾子，深著世樂，無有慧心。

All living beings are my children, deeply attached to worldly pleasures, without any wisdom."

三界無安，猶如火宅，眾苦充滿，甚可怖畏。

The three realms are not at peace, like a house on fire, full of suffering, extremely terrifying. 

常有生老、病死憂患，如是等火，熾然不息。

There are constant causes for worry, such as aging, sickness, and death, like fire burning continuously and unceasingly. 

如來已離，三界火宅，寂然閑居，安處林野。

The Tathagata has left the three realms of this burning house and now resides in peace in the forests and wilderness. 

今此三界，皆是我有，其中眾生，悉是吾子。

Today, these three realms are all under my control and all the living beings in them are my children. 

而今此處，多諸患難，唯我一人，能為救護。

However, in this place there are many difficulties and only I alone can protect and save them.

雖復教詔，而不信受，於諸欲染，貪著深故。

Although I teach and preach, they do not believe and receive it due to their deep attachment to their desires and cravings. 

以是方便，為說三乘，

Therefore, I use skilful means to speak of the Three Vehicles 

令諸眾生，知三界苦，開示演說，出世間道。

and make all living beings aware of the suffering in the three realms and explain the way to escape from the worldly life. 

是諸子等，若心決定，

These children, if they determine in their hearts, 

具足三明，及六神通，

have complete understanding of the Three Knowledges and Six Supernatural Powers, 

有得緣覺、不退菩薩。

and attain the awakened state through causal conditions, they will not fall from being Bodhisattvas.

汝舍利弗！我為眾生，以此譬喻，說一佛乘。

Śāriputra! I use this illustration to explain to sentient beings about the One Vehicle of the Buddha. 

汝等若能，信受是語，一切皆當，得成佛道。

If you and others can believe and accept these words, then you will all attain the Buddha Way. 

是乘微妙、清淨第一，於諸世間，為無有上，佛所悅可。

This vehicle is subtle and supremely pure, and among all worlds, there is nothing higher that is pleasing to the Buddha. 

一切眾生，所應稱讚、供養禮拜。

All sentient beings should praise and offer worship to this vehicle, 

無量億千，諸力解脫、禪定智慧，及佛餘法，得如是乘。

which leads to immeasurable billions of powers of liberation, meditative concentration, wisdom, and other teachings of the Buddha. 

令諸子等，日夜劫數，常得遊戲，

Let the sons and others spend countless kalpas playing and practicing this precious vehicle, 

與諸菩薩，及聲聞眾，乘此寶乘，直至道場。

together with bodhisattvas and the assembly of voice-hearers, until reaching the Way-place. 

以是因緣，十方諦求，更無餘乘，除佛方便。』

Because of this cause and circumstance, the truth sought by the ten directions is nothing other than this vehicle, except for the Buddha's provisional teachings." 

告舍利弗：『汝諸人等，皆是吾子，我則是父。

Gautama spoke to Śāriputra: "All of you are my children, and I am your father. 

汝等累劫，眾苦所燒，我皆濟拔，令出三界。

For countless kalpas, you have suffered the fires of suffering, but I will rescue and liberate you, leading you out of the three realms. 

我雖先說：「汝等滅度。」但盡生死，而實不滅；

"Although I previously said, 'May you all attain extinction,' in reality, you do not truly perish. 

今所應作，唯佛智慧。

What you should do now is to rely on the wisdom of the Buddha. 

若有菩薩，於是眾中，能一心聽，諸佛實法。

If there are Bodhisattvas among this multitude who can single-heartedly listen to the actual teachings of all Buddhas, 

諸佛世尊，雖以方便；所化眾生，皆是菩薩。

then even though all Buddhas employ various means to transform living beings, they are all Bodhisattvas. 

若人小智，深著愛欲，為此等故，說於苦諦。

If people possess a small amount of wisdom and are deeply attached to desires, for this reason, the Buddha speaks of suffering. 

眾生心喜，得未曾有，佛說苦諦，真實無異。

Living beings are pleased and receive what they have never had before. The Buddha's teachings of suffering are truly unchanging. 

若有眾生，不知苦本，深著苦因，不能暫捨。

If there are living beings who do not understand the root of suffering and are deeply attached to its cause, they cannot temporarily give it up. 

為是等故，方便說道。

For this reason, the Buddha employs means to explain the way. 

諸苦所因，貪欲為本，若滅貪欲，無所依止，滅盡諸苦，名第三諦。

The origin of all suffering lies in desire, and if desire is extinct, there is nothing to rely upon, and all suffering is entirely extinguished. This is named the Third Noble Truth. 

為滅諦故，修行於道，離諸苦縛，名得解脫。是人於何，而得解脫？

In order to extinguish this truth, one must practice the way and be liberated from the bonds of all suffering. Who is it that attains liberation? Only by leaving behind falsity, is it named liberation. 

但離虛妄，名為解脫；其實未得，一切解脫。

In reality, liberation has not been attained, all liberation is yet to be attained. 

佛說是人，未實滅度。

The Buddha says that this person has not actually achieved extinction. 

斯人未得，無上道故，我意不欲，令至滅度。

As this person has not yet attained it, they lack the supreme way. My intention is not to desire that they attain extinction."

我為法王，於法自在，安隱眾生，故現於世。

I am the king of dharma, and I am at ease with the dharma. I am here to bring peace to all beings, and that is why I appear in the world. 

汝舍利弗！我此法印，為欲利益，世間故說，

O Śāriputra! This seal of dharma that I have presented is only meant for the benefit of the world. 

在所遊方，勿妄宣傳。

Do not recklessly spread it around when you travel.

若有聞者，隨喜頂受，當知是人，阿鞞跋致。

If someone hears of it, they should accept it with joy upon their heads. You should know that this person is one of Ārya Vaipulya's disciples. 
 
若有信受，此經法者，是人已曾，見過去佛，恭敬供養，亦聞是法。

If someone accepts this teaching, they will have already seen me in the past, paid their respects and offerings to me, and heard this dharma. 

若人有能，信汝所說，則為見我，亦見於汝，及比丘僧，并諸菩薩。

If someone is able to believe in what you have said, then they will also see me and you and the monastic community, as well as all bodhisattvas. 

斯法華經，為深智說，淺識聞之，迷惑不解。

This Lotus Sutra is a deep teaching, and those with limited understanding will be confused and not comprehend it if they hear it. 

一切聲聞，及辟支佛，於此經中，力所不及。

All Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas are unable to understand it. 

汝舍利弗！尚於此經，以信得入；

O Śāriputra! You should believe in this sutra and enter it through faith. 

況餘聲聞。其餘聲聞，信佛語故，隨順此經，非己智分。

This applies to all Śrāvakas, not just your own understanding.

又舍利弗！憍慢懈怠、計我見者，莫說此經。

Again, Śāriputra! Don't talk about this scripture to people who are prideful, lazy, or clings to the concept of "self". 

凡夫淺識，深著五欲，聞不能解，亦勿為說。

Do not explain it to those with shallow knowledge, deeply attached to the five desires. They cannot understand it.

若人不信，毀謗此經，則斷一切，世間佛種。

If anyone slanders this sūtra, they will cut off all the Buddha seeds in the world. 

或復顰蹙，而懷疑惑，汝當聽說，此人罪報。

If they frown and have doubts and confusion, you should listen to the explanation of their sin. 

若佛在世，若滅度後，其有誹謗，如斯經典，

If the Buddha is in the world, or after he has passed away, those who defame such a sūtra 

見有讀誦、書持經者，

as this will see those who read and recite it, hold it in their hands, 

輕賤憎嫉，而懷結恨。

and they will have feelings of contempt, hatred and jealousy. 

此人罪報，汝今復聽。

Such people will receive retribution for their sin. 

其人命終，入阿鼻獄，具足一劫，劫盡更生。

When their life is over, they will enter the Avīci Hell and undergo a complete kalpa, after which they will be reborn. 

如是展轉，至無數劫，從地獄出，當墮畜生。

They will continue to suffer in this way for countless kalpas, and when they escape from hell, they will fall into the realm of beasts.

若狗野干，其形𩑔瘦，黧黮疥癩，人所觸嬈。

If they become a wild dog, their body will be thin, dark, scabby, and hated by people.

又復為人，之所惡賤，常困飢渴，

They will be reborn as a despised person, always hungry and thirsty, 

骨肉枯竭，生受楚毒，死被瓦石。

with bones and flesh withering away, suffering from diseases, and dying crushed by stones. 

斷佛種故，受斯罪報。

This is their retribution for cutting off the Buddha's seed.
 
若作馲駝，或生驢中，身常負重，加諸杖捶，

If they become a donkey or a mule, they will always bear heavy loads and be beaten with sticks, 

但念水草，餘無所知。

only thinking of food and water, with no knowledge of anything else.

謗斯經故，獲罪如是。

For slandering this sūtra, they will receive such retribution. 

有作野干，來入聚落，身體疥癩，又無一目。

If they become a wild animal, they will enter human settlements, with their body being scabby, and they will have no eyes. 

為諸童子，之所打擲，受諸苦痛，或時致死。

They will be thrown by children, suffer all kinds of pain, and sometimes die. 

於此死已，更受蟒身。

After this death, they will be reborn as a snake. 
 
其形長大，五百由旬，聾騃無足，宛轉腹行，

Its body will grow to five hundred yojanas, it will be deaf, dumb, and crawl on its belly. 

為諸小蟲，之所唼食，晝夜受苦，無有休息。

It will be eaten by small insects day and night, without any rest. 

謗斯經故，獲罪如是。

For slandering this sūtra, they will receive such retribution. 

若得為人，諸根闇鈍，矬陋攣躄，盲聾背傴。

If they are reborn as a human, they will have dull roots and be dull, ugly, and paralyzed, blind, deaf, and hunchbacked.

有所言說，人不信受，口氣常臭，鬼魅所著。

They will have things to say but will not be believed by others, and their breath will always stink, possessed by ghosts and demons. 

貧窮下賤，為人所使，多病痟瘦，無所依怙。

They will be poor, low, and despised, used by others, often sick and emaciated, with no support. 
 
雖親附人，人不在意，

Although they may attach themselves to others, they will not be cared for by others.

若有所得，尋復忘失。

If they gain something, they will forget it again soon.

若修醫道，順方治病，更增他疾，或復致死。

If they practice the medical arts, they will follow the methods to cure diseases, but they will increase others' illnesses or cause death.

若自有病，無人救療，設服良藥，而復增劇。

If they have their own illness, no one will save them.  Even if they take good medicine, their condition will worsen. 

若他反逆、抄劫竊盜，如是等罪，橫羅其殃。

If he is defiant and steals, he will face the consequences of such crimes. 

如斯罪人，永不見佛，眾聖之王，說法教化。

Such sinful people will never see the Buddha, the king of all the saints, and the teacher who teaches the Dharma. 

如斯罪人，常生難處，狂聾心亂，永不聞法。

Such sinful people will always face difficulties and will be crazy and deaf with a chaotic mind, and they will never hear the Dharma. 

於無數劫、如恒河沙，生輒聾瘂，諸根不具。

Over countless eons, they will constantly be deaf and dumb and will have missing senses. 

常處地獄，如遊園觀，

They will always reside in hell, like they are visiting a park, 

在餘惡道，如己舍宅，

and they will stay in other evil realms, like they are in their own homes. 

駝驢猪狗，是其行處。

They will associate with donkeys, pigs, and dogs, which are the places where they will reside. 

謗斯經故，獲罪如是。

They will suffer from diseases such as edema, drought, skin diseases, and boils, and they will wear such diseases as clothing. 

身常臭處，垢穢不淨，

Their bodies will constantly emit foul odors and will be dirty and unclean. 

深著我見，增益瞋恚，

Deeply attached to their self-centered views, they will increase their anger and animosity, 

婬欲熾盛，不擇禽獸。

and their lustful desires will blaze, they will not discriminate between birds and beasts. 

謗斯經故，獲罪如是。』

By slandering this scripture, they will suffer such consequences.

告舍利弗：『謗斯經者，若說其罪，窮劫不盡。

Śāriputra, those who speak against this sutra will fall into the endless cycle of reincarnation and suffering. 

以是因緣，我故語汝：

Therefore, I tell you this: 

「無智人中，莫說此經。」

Among those without wisdom, do not let them speak of this sutra. 

若有利根，智慧明了，多聞強識，求佛道者，如是之人，乃可為說。

However, those with roots of good and wisdom, those who listen and comprehend, those who seek the Buddha's path, those people may speak of this sutra. 

若人曾見，億百千佛，殖諸善本，深心堅固，如是之人，乃可為說。

If someone has seen countless Buddhas, cultivated good roots, and has a steadfast mind, then they may speak of this sutra.

若人精進，常修慈心，不惜身命，乃可為說。

若人恭敬，無有異心，離諸凡愚，獨處山澤，如是之人，乃可為說。

If someone is respectful and has no ill intentions, separates themselves from common ignorance, and lives in solitude in the mountains and valleys, then they may speak of this sutra.

若有比丘，為一切智，四方求法，合掌頂受，但樂受持，大乘經典，乃至不受，餘經一偈，如是之人，乃可為說。

If a bhikshu seeks the teachings in all directions, receives and holds the great vehicle sutras, joyful in receiving and holding them, to the point of not receiving anything else, and not even thinking of other sutras or the scriptures of other sects, then they may speak of this sutra. 

如人至心，求佛舍利，如是求經，得已頂受，其人不復，志求餘經，亦未曾念，外道典籍，如是之人，乃可為說。』

If someone seeks the Buddha's relics with a sincere heart, and seeks the sutras in the same manner, and upon obtaining them, accepts and holds them, without further seeking other sutras, not even thinking of them, then they may speak of this sutra. 

告舍利弗：『我說是相，求佛道者，窮劫不盡。』

Goshariputra, I declare these characteristics to be the qualifications of those who seek the Buddha's path and will never end the cycle of reincarnation. 

如是等人，則能信解，汝當為說，妙法華經。」

People like this should be able to believe and understand, and you should speak to them of the Lotus Sutra.
