A translation of Lotus Sutra from Chinese to English using ChatGPT (date: 20 Feb 2023)

妙法蓮華經授記品第六

The Lotus Sutra, Chapter on Prophecies Granted, Chapter 5.

爾時世尊說是偈已，告諸大眾，唱如是言：

At that time, the World-Honored One spoke this verse and said to the great assembly, singing these words:

「我此弟子摩訶迦葉，於未來世，當得奉覲三百萬億諸佛世尊，供養恭敬，尊重讚歎，廣宣諸佛無量大法。

"My disciple Mahakasyapa, in a future world, will receive and pay homage to three hundred trillion Buddhas, offering respectful service, honor, and praise, widely proclaiming the immeasurable great teachings of the Buddhas.

於最後身，得成為佛，名曰光明如來、應供、正遍知、明行足、善逝、世間解、無上士、調御丈夫、天人師、佛、世尊。

In his final body, he will attain Buddhahood, named the Tathagata Glorious Light, Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened, Endowed with Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Departed, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed Hero, Tamer of Beings, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.

國名光德，劫名大莊嚴。佛壽十二小劫，正法住世二十小劫，像法亦住二十小劫。

The name of his country will be Glorious Virtue, and the name of the eon will be Great Adornment. He will have a life span of twelve small eons and the True Dharma will last for twenty small eons, and the semblance Dharma will also last for twenty small eons.

國界嚴飾，無諸穢惡、瓦礫荊棘、便利不淨。

The boundaries of his country will be adorned with no filth or defilement, rubble or thorns, and will be conveniently pure.

其土平正，無有高下、坑坎堆阜。

The land will be level, without high or low points, ditches, ridges or mounds.

琉璃為地，寶樹行列，黃金為繩，以界道側，散諸寶華，周遍清淨。

The land will be of lapis lazuli, with rows of precious trees and golden cords marking the boundary paths, scattering flowers and enveloped in purity.

其國菩薩無量千億，諸聲聞眾亦復無數，無有魔事，雖有魔及魔民，皆護佛法。」

The bodhisattvas of his country will be countless, numbering in the thousands of billions, and the assembly of sound-hearers will also be limitless. There will be no demonic influences, and even if there are demons or demon people, they will protect the Buddha Dharma."

爾時世尊欲重宣此義，而說偈言：

At that time, the World Honored One wished to emphasize this meaning and spoke a verse, saying:

「告諸比丘：『我以佛眼，見是迦葉，於未來世，過無數劫，當得作佛。

"I declare to all the monks, With the Buddha's eye, I saw that in a future age, after countless eons, Kashyapa will become a Buddha.

而於來世，供養奉覲，三百萬億，諸佛世尊。為佛智慧，淨修梵行。

In a future age, he will make offerings and pay homage, to three hundred million Buddhas, the World Honored Ones. He will cultivate the Buddha's wisdom and practice the pure Brahman conduct.

供養最上，二足尊已，修習一切，無上之慧。於最後身，得成為佛。

Offering the highest homage to the two-footed ones and cultivating all supreme wisdom. In his final body, he will attain Buddhahood.

其土清淨，琉璃為地，多諸寶樹，行列道側，金繩界道，見者歡喜。

His land will be pure, with crystal as the ground, many precious trees will line the roads, golden ropes will mark the boundaries, and those who see it will rejoice.

常出好香，散眾名華，種種奇妙，以為莊嚴。
It will constantly emit fragrant scents and beautiful sounds, various wonders will adorn it as ornamentation.

其地平正，無有丘坑。

The land will be flat and even, with no hills or valleys.

諸菩薩眾，不可稱計，其心調柔，逮大神通，奉持諸佛，大乘經典。

The countless Bodhisattvas there cannot be counted, their minds are gentle, and they possess great supernatural powers, upholding the Buddhist teachings of the Mahayana scriptures.

諸聲聞眾，無漏後身，法王之子，亦不可計，乃以天眼，不能數知。

The numberless disciples who have attained the truth will also be there, sons of the Dharma King, impossible to count. Even with heavenly eyes, their number cannot be known.

其佛當壽，十二小劫；正法住世，二十小劫；像法亦住，二十小劫。

His Buddha lifespan will be twelve small eons, the true Dharma will last for twenty small eons, and the semblance Dharma will also last for twenty small eons.

光明世尊，其事如是。』」

Such will be the affairs of the Radiant Light World-Honored One."

爾時大目犍連、須菩提、摩訶迦栴延等，皆悉悚慄，一心合掌，瞻仰尊顏，目不暫捨，即共同聲而說偈言：

At that time, Great Maudgalyayana, Subhuti, Mahakasyapa, and others all trembled with fear, joined their palms together, gazed at the revered face, and did not look away for a moment. Together, they spoke these verses:

「大雄猛世尊，諸釋之法王，哀愍我等故，而賜佛音聲。

"Great and courageous World-Honored One, King of all teachings of the Shakyamuni, Out of compassion for us,
You grant us the sound of the Buddha's voice.

若知我深心，見為授記者，如以甘露灑，除熱得清涼。

If you know our sincere hearts, And recognize us as those to whom you transmit the Dharma, It is like sprinkling us with sweet dew, to relieve us of our heat and give us coolness.

如從饑國來，忽遇大王饍，心猶懷疑懼，未敢即便食；若復得王教，然後乃敢食。

It is like coming from a country of famine, And suddenly encountering a great feast hosted by a king.
Although our hearts are still doubtful and fearful, We dare not eat right away. Only after receiving the king's instruction, We can then eat in peace.

我等亦如是，每惟小乘過，不知當云何，得佛無上慧。

We are also like this, Whenever we think of the Hinayana's faults, Not knowing what to do, And unable to attain the Buddha's supreme wisdom.

雖聞佛音聲，言我等作佛，心尚懷憂懼，如未敢便食；

Although we hear the Buddha's voice and are told that we will become Buddhas, Our hearts are still full of worries and fears, Like being afraid to eat right away.

若蒙佛授記，爾乃快安樂。

Only after receiving the Buddha's prediction, can we be happy and at ease.

大雄猛世尊，常欲安世間，願賜我等記，如飢須教食。」

Great and courageous World-Honored One, You always wish to bring peace to the world, We hope you will grant us your prediction, As you would teach the hungry how to eat."

爾時世尊知諸大弟子心之所念，告諸比丘：

At that time, the World-Honored One knew the thoughts in the minds of his great disciples, and spoke to the assembly of monks:

「是須菩提，於當來世，奉覲三百萬億那由他佛，供養恭敬，尊重讚歎，常修梵行，具菩薩道。

"Subhuti, in a future life, will pay homage to and make offerings to three hundred million nayutas of Buddhas, with reverent respect, praising and admiring them. He will always practice the Brahma conduct and perfect the Bodhisattva path.

於最後身、得成為佛，號曰名相如來、應供、正遍知、明行足、善逝、世間解、無上士、調御丈夫、天人師、佛、世尊。

In his final life, he will attain Buddhahood, known as the Tathagata Name-Form, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Enlightened One, Endowed with Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed, Tamer of Humans, Teacher of Devas and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One.

劫名有寶。國名寶生。

The kalpa will be named Jeweled, and the country will be named Jeweled Birth.

其土平正，頗梨為地，寶樹莊嚴，無諸丘坑、沙礫、荊棘、便利之穢，寶華覆地，周遍清淨。

The land will be even and flat, made of beryl, adorned with precious trees, without any hills, pits, gravel, thorns, or other filth, covered with jeweled flowers and completely pure.

其土人民，皆處寶臺、珍妙樓閣。聲聞弟子，無量無邊，算數譬喻所不能知。

The people of that land will dwell in jeweled towers and beautiful palaces. The disciples who have attained the stage of Stream-Winner will be countless, beyond calculation or analogy.

諸菩薩眾，無數千萬億那由他。

The assembly of Bodhisattvas will be countless, numbering in the billions of nayutas.

佛壽十二小劫，正法住世二十小劫，像法亦住二十小劫。其佛常處虛空為眾說法，度脫無量菩薩及聲聞眾。」

The Buddha's lifespan will be twelve small kalpas, and the true Dharma will remain in the world for twenty small kalpas, while the semblance Dharma will also remain for twenty small kalpas. In that time, the Buddha will constantly teach the Dharma in the void, liberating immeasurable Bodhisattvas and Stream-Winners."

爾時世尊欲重宣此義，而說偈言：

At that time, the World-Honored One wanted to emphasize this meaning and spoke these verses:

「諸比丘眾，今告汝等，皆當一心，聽我所說：

"Monks, I now tell you all, with a single mind, listen to what I say:

我大弟子，須菩提者，當得作佛，號曰名相。

My great disciple, Subhuti, will become a Buddha, named 'Wonderful Appearance'.

當供無數，萬億諸佛，隨佛所行，漸具大道。

He will make offerings to countless, innumerable Buddhas and gradually perfect the great path in accordance with the Buddhas.

最後身得，三十二相，端正姝妙，猶如寶山。

In the end, his body will have the thirty-two characteristics, dignified and beautiful, like a precious mountain.

其佛國土，嚴淨第一，眾生見者，無不愛樂，佛於其中，度無量眾。

His Buddha-land will be the foremost in purity, and all living beings who see it will love and delight in it. The Buddha will use it to liberate countless sentient beings.

其佛法中，多諸菩薩，皆悉利根，轉不退輪，彼國常以，菩薩莊嚴。

Within his Buddha-dharma, there are many bodhisattvas, all with sharp faculties, turning the wheel of non-retrogression. In that land, bodhisattvas are adorned with splendor.

諸聲聞眾，不可稱數，皆得三明，具六神通，住八解脫，有大威德。

The countless disciples, beyond reckoning, all possess the threefold enlightenment, complete six supernatural powers, abide in the eight liberations, and have great virtue.

其佛說法，現於無量，神通變化，不可思議。

The Buddha's teachings are manifested in countless ways, with inconceivable changes in supernatural powers.

諸天人民，數如恒沙，皆共合掌，聽受佛語。

Heavenly beings and humans are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, all joining their palms in reverence, listening to the Buddha's words.

其佛當壽，十二小劫，正法住世，二十小劫，像法亦住，二十小劫。」

The Buddha will live for twelve small aeons, with the true Dharma in the world. For twenty small aeons, the semblance of the Dharma will also remain, and for another twenty small aeons."

爾時世尊復告諸比丘眾：

At that time, the World-Honored One spoke again to the assembly of monks, saying:

「我今語汝，是大迦旃延，於當來世，以諸供具，供養奉事八千億佛，恭敬尊重。

"I now tell you that in a future world, I will be a great King named 'Sagara' who will serve and make offerings to 8 trillion Buddhas with various offerings and services, with utmost respect and reverence.

諸佛滅後，各起塔廟，高千由旬，縱廣正等五百由旬，皆以金、銀、琉璃、車𤦲，馬瑙、真珠、玫瑰七寶合成，眾華、瓔珞、塗香、末香、燒香、繒蓋、幢幡，供養塔廟。

After the passing of each Buddha, I will construct a stupa or temple in their honor, each measuring 1,000 yojanas in height and 500 yojanas in width and length, made of the seven treasures of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, seashell, agate, pearl, and ruby, adorned with various flowers, jewels, fragrances, and banners, to be offered and maintained.

過是已後，當復供養二萬億佛，亦復如是。

After this, I will continue to make offerings and serve another 2 trillion Buddhas in the same manner.

供養是諸佛已，具菩薩道，當得作佛。號曰閻浮那提金光如來、應供、正遍知、明行足、善逝、世間解、無上士、調御丈夫、天人師、佛、世尊。

By making these offerings and following the path of the Bodhisattva, I will ultimately attain Buddhahood, known as the 'Sovereign Golden Light' Tathagata, worthy of offerings, perfect in knowledge and conduct, well-gone, knower of the world, unsurpassed guide for beings, tamer of humans, teacher of gods and humans.

其土平正，頗梨為地，寶樹莊嚴，黃金為繩以界道側，妙華覆地，周遍清淨，見者歡喜。

The land of my Buddha-realm will be flat and even, with Bodhi trees adorning it, bounded by a golden cord, covered with wonderful flowers, and completely pure, bringing joy to all who see it. 

無四惡道——地獄、餓鬼、畜生、阿修羅道，多有天、人、諸聲聞眾及諸菩薩，無量萬億莊嚴其國。

There will be no lower realms of existence such as hell, hungry ghosts, animals, or asuras, but rather many gods, humans, sound-hearers, and bodhisattvas, numbering in the countless trillions, all in a state of adornment.

My lifespan as a Buddha will be 12 small kalpas, my teachings of the correct Dharma will last for 20 small kalpas, and my teachings of the resembling Dharma will also last for 20 small kalpas."

佛壽十二小劫，正法住世二十小劫，像法亦住二十小劫。」

爾時世尊欲重宣此義，而說偈言：

「諸比丘眾、　　皆一心聽，　　如我所說，
真實無異。　　是迦栴延，　　當以種種，
妙好供具，　　供養諸佛。　　諸佛滅後，
起七寶塔，　　亦以華香，　　供養舍利。
其最後身，　　得佛智慧，　　成等正覺。
國土清淨，　　度脫無量，　　萬億眾生，
皆為十方，　　之所供養。　　佛之光明，
無能勝者。　　其佛號曰，　　閻浮金光。
菩薩聲聞，　　斷一切有，　　無量無數，
莊嚴其國。」

爾時世尊復告大眾：「我今語汝，是大目犍連，當以種種供具供養八千諸佛，恭敬尊重。諸佛滅後，各起塔廟，高千由旬，縱廣正等五百由旬，皆以金、銀、琉璃、車𤦲、馬瑙、真珠、玫瑰、七寶合成，眾華、瓔珞、塗香、末香、燒香、繒蓋、幢幡，以用供養。過是已後，當復供養二百萬億諸佛，亦復如是。當得成佛，號曰多摩羅跋栴檀香如來、應供、正遍知、明行足、善逝、世間解、無上士、調御丈夫、天人師、佛、世尊。劫名喜滿，國名意樂。其土平正，頗梨為地，寶樹莊嚴，散真珠華，周遍清淨，見者歡喜。多諸天、人、菩薩、聲聞，其數無量。佛壽二十四小劫，正法住世四十小劫，像法亦住四十小劫。」

爾時世尊欲重宣此義，而說偈言：

「我此弟子、　　大目犍連，　　捨是身已，
得見八千，　　二百萬億，　　諸佛世尊。
為佛道故，　　供養恭敬，　　於諸佛所，
常修梵行，　　於無量劫，　　奉持佛法。
諸佛滅後，　　起七寶塔，　　長表金剎，
華香伎樂，　　而以供養，　　諸佛塔廟。
漸漸具足，　　菩薩道已，　　於意樂國，
而得作佛。　　號多摩羅，　　栴檀之香。
其佛壽命，　　二十四劫，　　常為天人，
演說佛道。　　聲聞無量，　　如恒河沙，
三明六通，　　有大威德。　　菩薩無數，
志固精進，　　於佛智慧，　　皆不退轉。
佛滅度後，　　正法當住，　　四十小劫，
像法亦爾。　　我諸弟子，　　威德具足，
其數五百，　　皆當授記。　　於未來世、
咸得成佛。　　我及汝等，　　宿世因緣，
吾今當說，　　汝等善聽。」
