A translation of Lotus Sutra from Chinese to English using ChatGPT (date: 12 Feb 2023)

妙法蓮華經信解品第四

The Lotus Sutra, Chapter on Faith and Understanding, Chapter 4.

爾時慧命須菩提、摩訶迦旃延、摩訶迦葉、摩訶目犍連，

At that time, the wise and virtuous Purna, Mahakashyapa, Mahakatyayana, and Mahamogalanana, 

從佛所聞未曾有法，

who had never heard of such a thing from the Buddha,

世尊授舍利弗阿耨多羅三藐三菩提記，

heard the Buddha give a discourse on the record of Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi. 

發希有心，歡喜踊躍，即從座起，

They felt great joy and excitement, stood up from their seats,
 
整衣服偏袒右肩，右膝著地，
 
adjusted their robes so that the right shoulder was exposed, knelt on their right knee, 
 
一心合掌，曲躬恭敬，瞻仰尊顏而白佛言：

joined their hands in prayer, and respectfully inclined their heads to the Buddha while they said,

「我等居僧之首，年竝朽邁，

"We are the leaders of the sangha, and we are old and frail. 

自謂已得涅槃，無所堪任，

We thought we had already attained nirvana and had no further obligations. 

不復進求阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。

But we never sought the Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi. 

世尊往昔說法既久，

The Buddha has been preaching for a long time, 

我時在座，身體疲懈，

and although we were present, our bodies were tired, 

但念空、無相、無作，於菩薩法——遊戲神通、淨佛國土、成就眾生——心不喜樂。

and we did not enjoy the teachings of the bodhisattva path - the miraculous powers, the pure land of the Buddha, and the liberation of sentient beings - because we were focused on emptiness, non-duality, and non-action.

所以者何？世尊令我等出於三界，得涅槃證。

"Why is that? The Buddha has led us out of the three realms and enabled us to attain nirvana.

又今我等年已朽邁，於佛教化菩薩阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，不生一念好樂之心。

Now that we are old and fragile, we have not developed a single thought of joy in the teachings of the Buddha that guide us to attain Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi.

我等今於佛前，聞授聲聞阿耨多羅三藐三菩提記，心甚歡喜，得未曾有。

Now, in front of the Buddha, we have heard the teachings on Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi, and our hearts are filled with great joy, which we have never experienced before.

不謂於今，忽然得聞希有之法，深自慶幸，獲大善利，無量珍寶、不求自得。

It is not that we suddenly stumbled upon this rare teaching, but rather, we deeply rejoice in having obtained such a great benefit, an immeasurable treasure, without even seeking it.

「世尊！我等今者樂說譬喻以明斯義。

Lord Buddha, we now use joy to explain the meaning of this through parables.

譬若有人，年既幼稚，捨父逃逝，久住他國，

For example, there is a person who, when he was young, abandoned his father and ran away to another country. 

或十、二十，至五十歲，年既長大，加復窮困，馳騁四方以求衣食。

He lived there for ten, twenty, or even fifty years, growing older and increasingly poor, wandering in search of food and clothing.

漸漸遊行，遇向本國。

Gradually, he traveled and eventually reached his home country.

其父先來，求子不得，中止一城。

His father came first, searching for his son but was unable to find him and settled in a city.

其家大富，財寶無量——金、銀、琉璃、珊瑚、虎珀、頗梨珠等，其諸倉庫，悉皆盈溢；

His family was very wealthy, with an abundance of riches—gold, silver, glass, coral, tiger's eye, pearls, and so on—and his warehouses were overflowing.

多有僮僕、臣佐、吏民；

There were many servants, officials, and people;

象馬車乘，牛羊無數——出入息利，乃遍他國，商估賈客亦甚眾多。

Elephants and horses for riding, countless cattle and sheep — he had comfort and profit, and went everywhere in his country, with many merchants and buyers.

時貧窮子遊諸聚落，經歷國邑，遂到其父所止之城。

The poor son traveled through the settlements, passing through countries and cities, and eventually reached the city where his father was settled.

父每念子，與子離別五十餘年，

The father often thought of his son, and after being separated from his son for more than fifty years, 

而未曾向人說如此事，但自思惟，心懷悔恨，

he never told anyone about it, but he constantly thought to himself, feeling remorseful in his heart. 

自念老朽，多有財物，金銀珍寶，倉庫盈溢；

He realized he was getting old and had many possessions, including gold, silver, and treasures, and his warehouses were overflowing.

無有子息，一旦終沒，財物散失，無所委付。

But he had no children to inherit it, and once he died, his wealth would be lost and have no one to bequeath it to.

是以慇懃每憶其子，復作是念：

So the father was always thinking about his son and thought,

『我若得子，委付財物，坦然快樂，無復憂慮。』

'If I could find my son and entrust him with my wealth, I would be at peace and free from worry.

「世尊！爾時窮子傭賃展轉遇到父舍，住立門側。

Lord Buddha! At that time, the poor son who was hired to work came across his father's house and stood by the door. 

遙見其父、踞師子床，寶机承足，

He saw his father sitting on a chair and being served by Brahmans, shramanas, 

諸婆羅門、剎利、居士皆恭敬圍繞，以真珠瓔珞，價直千萬，莊嚴其身；

and lay people who surrounded him respectfully, adorning him with pearls and gems worth tens of millions of coins. 

吏民、僮僕，手執白拂，侍立左右。

Officials, servants, and servants stood on the left and right, holding white fans.

覆以寶帳，垂諸華幡，香水灑地，散眾名華，

A treasure tent was spread over him, and various fragrant flowers were scattered on the ground. 

羅列寶物，出內取與，有如是等種種嚴飾，威德特尊。

The display of various treasures was magnificent and awe-inspiring.

窮子見父有大力勢，即懷恐怖，悔來至此。

The poor son saw his father's great power and was filled with fear and regret for coming here. 

竊作是念：『此或是王，或是王等，非我傭力得物之處。

He secretly thought, "Perhaps this is a king or a nobleman, and this is not a place for me to get things with my hired labor. 

不如往至貧里，肆力有地，衣食易得。

It's better to go to a poor place where I can work and get food and clothing easily.

若久住此，或見逼迫，強使我作。』

If I stay here for a long time, I may be forced to do something."

作是念已，疾走而去。

Having thought this, he quickly left."

「時富長者於師子座，見子便識，心大歡喜，即作是念：

At that time, the wealthy man, while sitting on his son's seat, recognized his son and was greatly delighted, and then thought:

『我財物庫藏，今有所付。

'My treasure store has now been entrusted.

我常思念此子，無由見之，而忽自來，甚適我願。

I have always missed this son, but I cannot see him, but he suddenly came, which is exactly what I wish. 

我雖年朽，猶故貪惜。』

Although I am old, I still greedily cherish.'

即遣傍人，急追將還。爾時使者，疾走往捉。

So he immediately sent someone to quickly bring him back. At that time, the messenger quickly ran to capture him.

窮子驚愕，稱怨大喚：『我不相犯，何為見捉？』

The poor man was frightened and loudly complained, 'I have not committed any crimes, why am I being caught?'

使者執之愈急，強牽將還。

The messenger held him even more urgently and forcibly brought him back. 

于時窮子，自念無罪，而被囚執，此必定死；

At that time, the poor man thought that he was innocent, but was imprisoned and detained, which must surely lead to death.

轉更惶怖，悶絕躄地。

He became even more frightened and suffocated on the ground. 

父遙見之，而語使言：

The father, seeing this from a distance, spoke to the messenger:

『不須此人，勿強將來。

'This man is not needed, do not force him to come back. 

以冷水灑面，令得醒悟，莫復與語。』

Splash his face with cold water and let him wake up, and do not speak to him again.'

所以者何？父知其子志意下劣，

Why? The father knew that his son's ambition was inferior, 

自知豪貴為子所難，

and he knew that his own wealth and extravagance would be difficult for his son, 

審知是子而以方便，不語他人云是我子。

so he carefully considered and used convenience to not tell others that he was his son.

使者語之：『我今放汝，隨意所趣。』

The messenger said to him, 'I will release you now, follow your own wishes.'

窮子歡喜，得未曾有，從地而起，

The poor man was delighted, he received what he never had before, 

往至貧里、以求衣食。

and got up from the ground and went to the poor area to seek clothing and food.

爾時長者將欲誘引其子而設方便，密遣二人，形色憔悴無威德者：

At that time, the wealthy man wanted to entice his son, so he secretly sent two men who were poorly dressed and lacking in dignity.

『汝可詣彼，徐語窮子：「此有作處，倍與汝直。」

"You can go to him and slowly speak to the poor son: 'There is work here, and it pays double what you earn now.'

窮子若許，將來使作。

If the poor son agrees, then they will have him do it.

若言：「欲何所作？」

If he says, 'What do you want me to do?'

便可語之：「雇汝除糞。我等二人亦共汝作。」』

They can then tell him, 'Hire you to remove the manure. The two of us will work alongside you.'

時二使人即求窮子，既已得之，具陳上事。

The two men then went to the poor son and, having obtained him, they presented the matter."

「爾時窮子先取其價，尋與除糞。

The poor man first asked for his pay and then went to clean the manure.

其父見子，愍而怪之。

His father saw his son and felt sorry and angry.

又以他日，於窓牖中遙見子身，羸瘦憔悴，糞土塵坌，污穢不淨。

On another day, he saw his son's body from the window and saw that he was skinny and weak, covered in dirt and dust, and unclean.

即脫瓔珞、細軟上服、嚴飾之具，更著麁弊垢膩之衣，塵土坌身，

He took off his valuable clothing and fine accessories, put on dirty and worn clothes, and covered himself in dust and dirt. 

右手執持除糞之器，狀有所畏。

He held the cleaning tools with his right hand and looked afraid.

語諸作人：『汝等勤作，勿得懈息。』

He told the workers, "You all work hard, don't get lazy."

以方便故，得近其子。

He approached his son with this convenient plan.

後復告言：『咄，男子！

Later, he spoke again, "Listen, young man! 

汝常此作，勿復餘去，當加汝價。

You should always do this work, don't leave it behind. I'll increase your pay.

諸有所須瓫器米麵鹽醋之屬，莫自疑難，

Don't hesitate to ask for anything you need, like tools, rice, flour, salt, or vinegar. 

亦有老弊使人須者相給，好自安意。

You'll also have old and worn tools from the other workers. Just be comfortable and at ease.

我如汝父，勿復憂慮。

Consider me as your father, don't worry anymore.

所以者何？

Why is that? 

我年老大，而汝少壯，

I am old and you are young. 

汝常作時，無有欺怠瞋恨怨言，都不見汝有此諸惡，

When you work, I never see any deceit, laziness, anger, or resentment from you. 

如餘作人。

You're not like the other workers.

自今已後，如所生子。』

From now on, consider me as your father."

即時長者、更與作字，名之為兒。

The wealthy man then gave him a new name, calling him "son."

爾時窮子雖欣此遇，猶故自謂客作賤人。

Although the poor man was happy about this encounter, he still considered himself a guest worker.

由是之故，於二十年中常令除糞。

Because of this, he was ordered to clean the manure for 20 years.

過是已後，心相體信，入出無難，

After that, they had mutual trust and there was no difficulty in their relationship, 

然其所止猶在本處。

but he still stayed in the same place."

「世尊，爾時長者有疾，自知將死不久。

At that time, the wealthy man was ill and knew that he was going to die soon. 

語窮子言：『我今多有金銀珍寶，倉庫盈溢，

He spoke to the poor man and said, "I have a lot of gold, silver, and treasures in my storage, 

其中多少、所應取與，汝悉知之。

and you know how much of it you should take. 

我心如是，當體此意。所以者何？

My mind is like this, so I want you to pay attention and not miss anything. Why is that?

今我與汝，便為不異，宜加用心，無令漏失。』

Now, I and you, we are not different, it is appropriate to pay attention and not to let anything go missing.

爾時窮子，即受教勅，領知眾物，金銀珍寶及諸庫藏，

The poor man then followed the instructions and learned about the gold, silver, and treasures in the storage, 

而無悕取一飡之意。

And without any regret of taking anything for himself.

然其所止故在本處，下劣之心亦未能捨。

However, his place of staying remains the same, and his inferior thoughts have not yet been able to be given up.

復經少時，父知子意漸已通泰，

After a short time, the father realized that his son's mind was gradually becoming mature 

成就大志，

and achieving his great aspirations, 

自鄙先心。

and he had humble feelings.

臨欲終時，而命其子并會親族、國王、大臣、剎利、居士，皆悉已集，

As he was about to die, he summoned his son, as well as his relatives, the king, the ministers, the brahmins, and the laypeople, 

即自宣言：『諸君當知！此是我子，我之所生。

and declared, "Everyone should know that this is my son, who I gave birth to. 

於某城中、捨吾逃走，伶俜辛苦五十餘年，其本字某。

He ran away from our city and has suffered for over fifty years. His name is such and such.

我名某甲，昔在本城懷憂推覓，忽於此間遇會得之。

I am such and such, and I once searched for him in our city and unexpectedly found him here. 

此實我子，我實其父。

He is truly my son, and I am truly his father. 

今我所有一切財物，皆是子有，先所出內，是子所知。』

All my possessions are his, and he knows what I have given him."

「世尊！是時窮子聞父此言，

Lord Buddha! When the poor man heard his father's words, 

即大歡喜，得未曾有，而作是念：

he was very happy and felt that he had never been so happy before. 

『我本無心有所希求，今此寶藏自然而至。』

He thought to himself, "I never had any desire, but now this treasure has come to me naturally."


「世尊！大富長者則是如來，我等皆似佛子，如來常說我等為子。世尊！我等以三苦故，於生死中受諸熱惱，迷惑無知，樂著小法。今日世尊令我等思惟，蠲除諸法戲論之糞，我等於中勤加精進，得至涅槃一日之價。既得此已，心大歡喜，自以為足，而便自謂：『於佛法中勤精進故，所得弘多。』然世尊先知我等，心著弊欲，樂於小法，便見縱捨，不為分別：『汝等當有如來知見寶藏之分。』世尊以方便力，說如來智慧。我等從佛，得涅槃一日之價，以為大得；於此大乘，無有志求。我等又因如來智慧，為諸菩薩開示演說，而自於此無有志願。所以者何？佛知我等心樂小法，以方便力、隨我等說；而我等不知真是佛子。今我等方知世尊，於佛智慧無所悋惜。所以者何？我等昔來真是佛子，而但樂小法，若我等有樂大之心，佛則為我說大乘法。於此經中唯說一乘，而昔於菩薩前，毀呰聲聞樂小法者，然佛實以大乘教化。是故我等，說本無心有所悕求。今法王大寶自然而至，如佛子所應得者皆已得之。」爾時摩訶迦葉欲重宣此義，而說偈言：

「我等今日，　　聞佛音教，　　歡喜踊躍，
得未曾有。　　佛說聲聞，　　當得作佛，
無上寶聚，　　不求自得。　　譬如童子，
幼稚無識，　　捨父逃逝，　　遠到他土，
周流諸國，　　五十餘年。　　其父憂念，
四方推求，　　求之既疲，　　頓止一城，
造立舍宅，　　五欲自娛。　　其家巨富，
多諸金銀、　　車𤦲馬腦、　　真珠琉璃；
象馬牛羊、　　輦輿車乘；　　田業僮僕、
人民眾多。　　出入息利，　　乃遍他國，
商估賈人、　　無處不有。　　千萬億眾，
圍繞恭敬，　　常為王者，　　之所愛念，
群臣豪族，　　皆共宗重。　　以諸緣故，
往來者眾，　　豪富如是，　　有大力勢。
而年朽邁，　　益憂念子，　　夙夜惟念，
死時將至。　　癡子捨我，　　五十餘年，
庫藏諸物，　　當如之何？　　爾時窮子，
求索衣食，　　從邑至邑、　　從國至國。
或有所得，　　或無所得，　　飢餓羸瘦，
體生瘡癬。　　漸次經歷，　　到父住城，

於其門內，　　施大寶帳，　　處師子座；
眷屬圍遶，　　諸人侍衛，　　或有計算，
金銀寶物，　　出內財產，　　注記券䟽。
窮子見父，　　豪貴尊嚴，　　謂是國王，
若是王等。　　驚怖自怪，　　何故至此。
覆自念言：　　『我若久住，　　或見逼迫，
強驅使作。』　　思惟是已，　　馳走而去，
借問貧里，　　欲往傭作。　　長者是時，
在師子座，　　遙見其子，　　默而識之。

無生無滅，　　無大無小，　　無漏無為。
如是思惟，　　不生喜樂。　　我等長夜，
於佛智慧，　　無貪無著，　　無復志願；

佛亦如是，　　現希有事，　　知樂小者，
以方便力，　　調伏其心，　　乃教大智。
我等今日，　　得未曾有，　　非先所望，
而今自得，　　如彼窮子，　　得無量寶。
世尊我今，　　得道得果，　　於無漏法，
得清淨眼。　　我等長夜，　　持佛淨戒，
始於今日，　　得其果報，　　法王法中，
久修梵行，　　今得無漏，　　無上大果。
我等今者，　　真是聲聞，　　以佛道聲，
令一切聞。　　我等今者，　　真阿羅漢，
於諸世間，　　天人魔梵，　　普於其中，
應受供養。　　世尊大恩，　　以希有事，
憐愍教化，　　利益我等，　　無量億劫，
誰能報者。　　手足供給，　　頭頂禮敬，
一切供養，　　皆不能報。　　若以頂戴，
兩肩荷負，　　於恒沙劫，　　盡心恭敬；
又以美饍、　　無量寶衣，　　及諸臥具、
種種湯藥，　　牛頭栴檀，　　及諸珍寶，
以起塔廟，　　寶衣布地。　　如斯等事，
以用供養，　　於恒沙劫，　　亦不能報。
諸佛希有，　　無量無邊，　　不可思議，
大神通力，　　無漏無為，　　諸法之王。
能為下劣，　　忍于斯事，　　取相凡夫，
隨宜為說。　　諸佛於法，　　得最自在，
知諸眾生，　　種種欲樂，　　及其志力。
隨所堪任，　　以無量喻，　　而為說法。
隨諸眾生，　　宿世善根，　　又知成熟、
未成熟者，　　種種籌量，　　分別知已，
於一乘道、　　隨宜說三。」
