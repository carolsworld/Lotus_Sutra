Prologue, Chapter 1.


如是我聞：

Thus I have heard:"

一時，佛住王舍城耆闍崛山中，與大比丘眾萬二千人俱，皆是阿羅漢，諸漏已盡，無復煩惱，逮得己利，盡諸有結，心得自在。

爾時世尊，四眾圍遶，供養、恭敬、尊重、讚歎。

At that time, the World-Honored One was surrounded by the four assemblies who made offerings, showed reverence, honored and praised him. 

為諸菩薩說大乘經，名無量義，教菩薩法，佛所護念。

He taught the Lotus Sutra, named "Limitless Meanings," to the bodhisattvas, protected by the Buddha. 

佛說此經已，結加趺坐，入於無量義處三昧，身心不動。

The Buddha finished speaking this sutra, sat down with his legs crossed, entered into the state of meditative concentration of limitless meanings, with his body and mind not moving. 

是時天雨曼陀羅華、摩訶曼陀羅華、曼殊沙華、摩訶曼殊沙華而散佛上及諸大眾。

At that time, the celestial rain of mandarava flowers, the great mandarava flowers, the manjushaka flowers, and the great manjushaka flowers, scattered over the Buddha and the great assembly. 

普佛世界，六種震動。

The world of all Buddhas shook in six ways. 

爾時會中，比丘、比丘尼、優婆塞、優婆夷、天龍、夜叉、乾闥婆、阿修羅、迦樓羅、緊那羅、摩睺羅伽、人非人，及諸小王、轉輪聖王，是諸大眾，得未曾有，歡喜合掌，一心觀佛。

At that assembly, there were monks, nuns, laymen and laywomen, heavenly dragons, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, kalavinkas, kinnaras, mahoragas, and beings not human, as well as small kings and wheel-turning sage kings. This great assembly, having obtained what they had never before obtained, rejoiced, joined their hands in prayer, and with one mind observed the Buddha.

爾時佛放眉間白毫相光，照東方萬八千世界，靡不周遍，下至阿鼻地獄，上至阿迦尼吒天。

At that time, the Buddha emitted a white light from his forehead that illuminated the eastern direction of the world of 80,000, shining everywhere, reaching down to the Avici hell and up to the Akanistha heaven. 

於此世界，盡見彼土六趣眾生，又見彼土現在諸佛，及聞諸佛所說經法。

In this world, he saw all the living beings of the six realms in that land, as well as the present Buddhas in that land, and heard the teachings of the sutras taught by the Buddhas. 

并見彼諸比丘、比丘尼、優婆塞、優婆夷，諸修行得道者。

He also saw the bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, upasakas, upasikas, and those who had attained the path through cultivation. 

復見諸菩薩摩訶薩，種種因緣、種種信解、種種相貌，行菩薩道。

He also saw the bodhisattvas mahasattvas, various causes and conditions, various beliefs and understandings, and various appearances, who were walking the bodhisattva path. 

復見諸佛般涅槃者。復見諸佛般涅槃後，以佛舍利起七寶塔。

He also saw the Buddhas who had attained parinirvana, and after the parinirvana of the Buddhas, he saw the seven-jeweled pagodas that arose from the Buddha's relics.

爾時彌勒菩薩作是念：「今者世尊現神變相，以何因緣而有此瑞？今佛世尊入于三昧，是不可思議、現希有事。當以問誰？誰能答者？」

Then, Maitreya Bodhisattva had these thoughts: "Now the World-Honored One is displaying his miraculous appearance, what is the cause and condition for this auspicious sign? The Buddha is now in a state of deep meditation, it is beyond comprehension and extremely rare. Who should I ask, and who can answer?" 

復作此念：「是文殊師利，法王之子，已曾親近供養過去無量諸佛，必應見此希有之相。我今當問。」

He then thought: "It must be the Master of Teaching, the son of the Dharma King, who has already paid close respect to immeasurable Buddhas in the past, he should be able to see this rare appearance. I will ask now."

爾時比丘、比丘尼、優婆塞、優婆夷，及諸天、龍、鬼神等，咸作此念：「是佛光明神通之相，今當問誰？」

At that time, the bhikshus, bhikshunis, upasakas, upasikas, and all the gods, dragons, ghosts and spirits all thought: "This is the appearance of the Buddha's brilliant supernatural power, who should we ask now?"

爾時彌勒菩薩欲自決疑，又觀四眾比丘、比丘尼、優婆塞、優婆夷，及諸天，龍、鬼神等眾會之心，

At that time, Maitreya Bodhisattva wanted to resolve his doubts and also observed the minds of the four assemblies of monks, nuns, upāsakas, and upāsikās, as well as those of the gods, dragons, spirits, and other groups. 

而問文殊師利言：「以何因緣而有此瑞神通之相，放大光明，照于東方萬八千土，悉見彼佛國界莊嚴？」

He asked Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, "What is the cause and condition for this auspicious manifestation of great supernatural power and light, shining brightly in the eastern direction and illuminating the thousands of lands in that direction, so that the magnificent splendor of all the buddha-lands is seen?" 



於是彌勒菩薩欲重宣此義，以偈問曰：

Maitreya Bodhisattva wanted to explain this meaning further, so he asked with a verse:

「文殊師利！導師何故，眉間白毫，大光普照。 

「Manjusri! Why is it that the guide's eyebrows have white hair and emit a bright light that illuminates all?

雨曼陀羅、曼殊沙華，栴檀香風，悅可眾心？

Why are the mandarava flowers, manjushaka flowers, sandalwood fragrance, and the pleasing wind all so delightful to the hearts of the assembly?

以是因緣，地皆嚴淨，而此世界，六種震動。

Due to these causes and conditions, the earth is perfectly pure and this world is shaken by six kinds of vibrations.

時四部眾，咸皆歡喜，身意快然，得未曾有。　　

At that time, the four assemblies are all filled with joy, their bodies and minds are at ease, and they experience a happiness they have never known before.

眉間光明，照于東方，萬八千土，皆如金色，從阿鼻獄，上至有頂。

The light between their eyebrows shines in the east and illuminates the 8,000 lands, which are all as golden as the color of the light.

諸世界中，六道眾生，生死所趣，善惡業緣，受報好醜，於此悉見。

From the hells to the highest heavens, all the worlds in the six realms of existence, the destinations of birth and death, the causes of good and evil, the reception of their rewards, be they beautiful or ugly, are all seen here.

又覩諸佛、聖主師子、演說經典，微妙第一。

Is the Buddha sitting in this place of the path to express the wonderful teachings he has obtained, or to bestow them?

文殊當知，四眾龍神，瞻察仁者，為說何等。」

Bodhisattva Manjushri should know that the four assemblies, the gods, dragons, and spirits, as well as the benevolent ones who observe, are speaking about what.」

爾時文殊師利語彌勒菩薩摩訶薩及諸大士：

At that time, Manjusri spoke to Maitreya Bodhisattva and the great sages, 

「善男子等！如我惟忖，今佛世尊欲說大法，雨大法雨，吹大法螺，擊大法鼓，演大法義。

"Good men! As I think about it, the Buddha-World-Honored One wishes to speak the great Dharma. It is raining great Dharma, blowing the great Dharma conch, beating the great Dharma drum, and expressing the great Dharma's meaning. 

諸善男子！我於過去諸佛，曾見此瑞，放斯光已，即說大法。

Good men! In the past, I have seen this kind of auspicious signs when the Buddha-World-Honored One was about to speak the great Dharma. 

是故當知，今佛現光，亦復如是，欲令眾生，咸得聞知一切世間難信之法，故現斯瑞。

Therefore, you should know that the present Buddha's light is also like this, and he wants all living beings to hear and know all the difficult-to-believe Dharma in the world, hence this appearance of auspicious signs.

「諸善男子！如過去無量無邊不可思議阿僧祇劫，爾時有佛，號日月燈明如來、應供、正遍知、明行足、善逝世間解、無上士、調御丈夫、天人師、佛、世尊，演說正法，初善中善後善，其義深遠，其語巧妙，純一無雜，具足清白梵行之相。

"Good men! In the past, an incalculable, boundless, and inconceivable number of asaṃkhyeya kalpas ago, there was a Buddha named 'Illuminator of the Sun and Moon, Tathagata, Accommodating, Correctly Understanding, Equipped with Correct Conduct, Well-Gone One, Unsurpassed Sage, Master of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One,' who taught the correct Dharma, first teaching the good, then teaching the middle good, and finally teaching the ultimate good. Its meaning was profound and distant, its language was skillful and subtle, pure and unadulterated, fully possessing the characteristics of pure Brahmin conduct. 

為求聲聞者說應四諦法，度生老病死，究竟涅槃；

He taught the Four Noble Truths to the listeners, to help them cross over birth, old age, sickness, and death and attain ultimate Nirvana. 

為求辟支佛者說應十二因緣法；

He taught the Twelve Causes and Conditions to the pratyekabuddhas. 

為諸菩薩說應六波羅蜜，令得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，成一切種智。

He taught the Six Perfections to the bodhisattvas, enabling them to attain anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi and all kinds of wisdom."

「次復有佛亦名日月燈明，次復有佛亦名日月燈明，如是二萬佛，皆同一字，號日月燈明，又同一姓，姓頗羅墮。

"Furthermore, there is also a Buddha named the Lamp of the Sun and Moon. Again, there are 20,000 Buddhas, all with the same name, called the Lamp of the Sun and Moon, and also the same surname, named Kshudraka. 

彌勒當知，初佛後佛，皆同一字，名日月燈明，十號具足。

Maitreya should know that the first Buddha, the latter Buddha, all have the same name, named the Lamp of the Sun and Moon, with ten complete titles. 

所可說法，初中後善。

The teachings they can speak are the initial, middle, and last good. 

其最後佛，未出家時有八王子：一名有意，二名善意，三名無量意，四名寶意，五名增意，六名除疑意，七名嚮意，八名法意。

The final Buddha, before leaving the household, had eight princely sons: one was named 'Intention,' two was named 'Good Intention,' three was named 'Incomparable Intention,' four was named 'Treasure Intention,' five was named 'Increasing Intention,' six was named 'Removing Doubts Intention,' seven was named 'Guiding Intention,' and eight was named 'Dharma Intention.' 

是八王子，威德自在，各領四天下。

These eight princely sons were all powerful and free, each ruling over four continents. 

是諸王子，聞父出家，得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，悉捨王位亦隨出家，發大乘意，常修梵行，皆為法師，已於千萬佛所、殖諸善本。

These kings heard that their father left the household and attained Anuttara Samyak Sambodhi, and so they renounced their throne and also left the household, developed the great vehicle's intention, constantly practiced virtuous behavior, and all became dharma teachers, propagating various good roots to millions of Buddhas.

「是時日月燈明佛說大乘經，名無量義，教菩薩法，佛所護念。

At that time, the Buddha named "Sun and Moon Lamp Shining" spoke the sutra of the Great Vehicle, named "Limitless Meanings", teaching the method for bodhisattvas. It is guarded by the Buddha's mindfulness. 

說是經已，即於大眾中結加趺坐，入於無量義處三昧，身心不動。

After speaking the sutra, he immediately sat cross-legged in the assembly, entered into a state of meditation on the realm of limitless meanings, and his body and mind remained still. 

是時、天雨曼陀羅華，摩訶曼陀羅華，曼殊沙華，摩訶曼殊沙華，而散佛上、及諸大眾。

At that time, heavenly rain of mandala flowers, flowers of the Mora realm, and other such flowers descended upon the Buddha and the assembly, filling the world of all Buddhas. 

普佛世界，六種震動。

The world shook in six ways. 

爾時會中，比丘、比丘尼、優婆塞、優婆夷，天、龍、夜叉、乾闥婆、阿修羅、迦樓羅、緊那羅、摩睺羅伽、人非人，及諸小王、轉輪聖王等，是諸大眾，得未曾有，歡喜合掌，一心觀佛。

In the assembly, bhiksus, bhiksunis, upasakas, upasikas, gods, dragons, yaksas, gandharvas, asuras, kalavinkas, maharajas, and other such beings, including small kings, wheel-turning kings, and others, the entire assembly, obtained what they had never had before, with joyful hands joined in prayer, they all focused on the Buddha with a single mind.

「爾時如來放眉間白毫相光，照東方萬八千佛土，靡不周遍，如今所見是諸佛土。

At that time, the Tathagata emitted a white light from between his eyebrows, illuminating the eastern direction and the lands of the 80,000 buddhas, spreading everywhere and just as seen now. 

彌勒當知，爾時會中，有二十億菩薩樂欲聽法。是諸菩薩，見此光明、普照佛土，得未曾有，欲知此光所為因緣。

Maitreya should know that at that assembly, there were 200 million bodhisattvas delighting in hearing the dharma. These bodhisattvas, upon seeing this light, the universal illumination of buddha lands, obtained something they had never had before, desiring to know the causes and conditions of this light. 

時有菩薩，名曰妙光，有八百弟子。是時日月燈明佛從三昧起，因妙光菩薩、說大乘經，名妙法蓮華，教菩薩法，佛所護念，六十小劫不起于座。

There was a bodhisattva named Radiant Wisdom, with 800 disciples. At that time, the Buddha of Sun, Moon, and Lamp Illumination rose from meditation, and through Radiant Wisdom bodhisattva, taught the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, teaching bodhisattva methods, what the Buddha guarded and cherished, for 60 small kalpas without leaving his seat. 

時會聽者亦坐一處，六十小劫身心不動，聽佛所說，謂如食頃。

The listeners were also seated in one place, for 60 small kalpas, their bodies and minds unmoved, listening to what the Buddha said, as if eating with relish. 

是時眾中，無有一人若身若心而生懈惓。

Among the assembly, not a single person was slothful in body or mind.

「日月燈明佛於六十小劫說是經已，即於梵、魔、沙門、婆羅門、及天、人、阿修羅眾中，而宣此言：『如來於今日中夜，當入無餘涅槃。』

"The Buddha of the Lamp of the Sun and Moon spoke the scriptures to the Brahma, demon, Buddhist monk, Brahmin, and celestial, human, and demon realms. He proclaimed, 'The Tathagata will enter parinirvana at midnight today.' 

時有菩薩，名曰德藏，日月燈明佛即授其記。

At that time, there was a bodhisattva named Dézàng, who was given the prediction by the Buddha of the Lamp of the Sun and Moon. 

告諸比丘：『是德藏菩薩，次當作佛，號曰淨身多陀阿伽度、阿羅訶、三藐三佛陀。』

He told the bhikshus, 'Dézàng bodhisattva will be the next Buddha and will be called Purity of the Body, Dharmakāya, Ārya, the Buddha of the Three Refuges.' 

佛授記已，便於中夜、入無餘涅槃。

After the Buddha gave the prediction, he entered parinirvana at midnight. 

佛滅度後，妙光菩薩持妙法蓮華經，滿八十小劫為人演說。

After the Buddha's passing, the bodhisattva named Wonderful Light held the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma and taught it for 80 small kalpas. 

日月燈明佛八子皆師妙光，妙光教化令其堅固阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。

The eight sons of the Buddha of the Lamp of the Sun and Moon were all disciples of Wonderful Light and he taught them so that they could firmly hold the Three Refuges and Three Bodhisattva Grounds. 

是諸王子、供養無量百千萬億佛已，皆成佛道，其最後成佛者，名曰燃燈。

The kings' sons offered unlimited offerings to countless Buddhas and all of them became Buddhas. The last one to become a Buddha was named Lamp. 

八百弟子中，有一人號曰求名，貪著利養，雖復讀誦眾經，而不通利，多所忘失，故號求名。

Among the 800 disciples, there was one named Seeking Fame who was greedy for wealth and benefits, despite reading many scriptures, he still did not understand the benefits and often forgot them, hence the name Seeking Fame. 

是人亦以種諸善根因緣故，得值無量百千萬億諸佛，供養、恭敬，尊重、讚歎。

However, due to having planted many good roots and causes, he was able to offer and pay respect to countless Buddhas and was honored and praised by them. 

彌勒當知，爾時妙光菩薩豈異人乎？我身是也；求名菩薩，汝身是也。

Maitreya, should you not know that Wonderful Light bodhisattva was me and Seeking Fame bodhisattva was you? 

今見此瑞，與本無異，是故惟忖：『今日如來當說大乘經，名妙法蓮華，教菩薩法，佛所護念。』」

Now when we see this sign, it is not different from our original nature, so we should ponder: 'Today, the Tathagata will speak the Mahayana sutras, called the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma, teaching the bodhisattva dharma and protected by the Buddha.'

爾時文殊師利於大眾中，欲重宣此義，而說偈言：

At that time, Mañjuśrī, in the midst of the assembly, wished to re-emphasize this meaning and spoke this verse:

「我念過去世，無量無數劫，有佛人中尊，號日月燈明。

"I remember past lives, countless kalpas, there was a revered being among the Buddha, called the Sun and Moon Lamp Enlightenment.

世尊演說法，度無量眾生，無數億菩薩，令入佛智慧。

The World-Honored One taught the Dharma, saved countless living beings, and numerous billions of bodhisattvas, leading them to Buddha's wisdom.

佛未出家時，所生八王子，見大聖出家，亦隨修梵行。

Before the Buddha left the household life, he was born as the son of eight kings, who saw the great saint leave the household and also cultivated Buddhist practices.

時佛說大乘，經名無量義，於諸大眾中，而為廣分別。

At that time, the Buddha taught the Mahayana, the sutra named Immeasurable Meanings, in the midst of the great assembly, and extensively differentiated it.

佛說此經已，即於法座上，加趺坐三昧，名無量義處。

The Buddha having spoken this sutra, then on the Dharma seat, entered into a samadhi called Immeasurable Meanings."

天雨曼陀華，天鼓自然鳴，諸天龍鬼神，供養人中尊。

The rain of mandalas from the heavens, the drum from the heavens that naturally sounds, all the gods, dragons, and spirits in the heavens, offer worship to the honorable one in the assembly.

一切諸佛土，即時大震動，佛放眉間光，現諸希有事。

All the Buddha lands immediately shake with great quakes, and the Buddha radiates light from between his eyebrows, showing various wonderful things.

此光照東方，萬八千佛土，示一切眾生，生死業報處。

This light illuminates the eastern direction, to the ten thousand and eight thousand Buddha lands, showing all sentient beings the place where they experience the results of their actions and causes in life and death.

有見諸佛土，以眾寶莊嚴，琉璃頗梨色，斯由佛光照。

Seeing the various Buddha lands, they are adorned with countless treasures, with a color like clear and transparent lapis lazuli, due to the Buddha's light shining upon them.

及見諸天人、龍神夜叉眾、乾闥緊那羅，各供養其佛。

And he sees all the heavenly beings, dragons, gods, yakshas, and gandharvas, each offering worship to their own Buddha.

又見諸如來，自然成佛道，身色如金山，端嚴甚微妙。

And he sees all the Tathagatas, who have naturally achieved the Buddha way, with a body like a gold mountain, dignified and extremely subtle and delicate.

如淨琉璃中，內現真金像，世尊在大眾，敷演深法義。

Like within a pure crystal, the true golden image appears internally, the World-Honored One among the assembly, expounds deeply the meaning of the Dharma.

一一諸佛土，聲聞眾無數，因佛光所照，悉見彼大眾。

In each and every Buddha land, the voice-hearer assembly is countless, and due to the Buddha's light shining upon them, they all see that great assembly.

或有諸比丘，在於山林中，精進持淨戒，猶如護明珠。

Or there are some bhikshus in the mountains and forests, diligently upholding pure commandments, like guarding a bright pearl.

又見諸菩薩，行施忍辱等，其數如恒沙，斯由佛光照。

And he sees all the Bodhisattvas, practicing giving, endurance, and so forth, their number like the grains of sand in the Ganges, due to the Buddha's light shining upon them.

又見諸菩薩，深入諸禪定，身心寂不動，以求無上道。

And he sees all the Bodhisattvas, deeply entering into various meditations, with their body and mind completely still, seeking the supreme way.

又見諸菩薩，知法寂滅相，各於其國土，說法求佛道。

And he sees all the Bodhisattvas, who understand the nature of the Dharma and nirvana, each in their own country and land, expounding the Dharma and seeking the Buddha's way.

爾時四部眾，見日月燈佛，現大神通力，其心皆歡喜，各各自相問：『是事何因緣？』

At that time, the four groups of people saw the light of the sun and moon Buddha and were amazed by the great supernatural power. They were all happy and asked each other, "What is the cause and reason for this event?"

天人所奉尊，適從三昧起，讚妙光菩薩：『汝為世間眼，一切所歸信，能奉持法藏，如我所說法，唯汝能證知。』

The heavenly beings, who worshiped the honored one, rose from their meditative state, and praised the wonderful light Bodhisattva: "You are the eyes of the world, the trust of all, able to maintain the Dharma Treasury, just as I have explained, only you can truly understand."

世尊既讚歎，令妙光歡喜，說是法華經，滿六十小劫，不起於此座。

The World-Honored One praised and made the wonderful light happy, saying that this Lotus Sutra will be completed within sixty small kalpas and will not rise from this seat.

所說上妙法，是妙光法師，悉皆能受持。

The supremely wonderful Dharma that was spoken of is taught by the wonderful light Dharma master and can be upheld by all.

佛說是法華，令眾歡喜已，尋即於是日，告於天人眾：『諸法實相義，已為汝等說，我今於中夜，當入於涅槃。

The Buddha spoke of the Lotus Sutra, making the assembly happy, and immediately on that day, he informed the assembly of heavenly beings: "The truth of all phenomena has been explained to you. Today, in the middle of the night, I will enter into Nirvana.

汝一心精進，當離於放逸，諸佛甚難值，億劫時一遇。』

With a single-minded, diligent effort, you should abandon indulgence. It is difficult to encounter a Buddha even after countless kalpas."

世尊諸子等，聞佛入涅槃，各各懷悲惱，佛滅一何速。

The Buddha and his children heard that the Buddha was entering nirvana. Each of them felt grief and sorrow. 

聖主法之王，安慰無量眾：『我若滅度時，汝等勿憂怖，是德藏菩薩，於無漏實相，心已得通達。其次當作佛，號曰為淨身，亦度無量眾。』

The king of the law, the sage, comforted the countless assembly, saying, "When I pass away, do not be afraid or frightened. The virtue store Bodhisattva has already attained the real aspect of the non-leakage, and his heart has been realized.
And next, he will become a Buddha, known as the Pure Body. He will also save countless people."

佛此夜滅度，如薪盡火滅，分布諸舍利，而起無量塔。

The Buddha passed away this night, like a fire being extinguished when the fuel is used up. The ashes of the relics were distributed and countless stupas arose.

比丘比丘尼，其數如恒沙，倍復加精進，以求無上道。

The bhikshus and bhikshunis, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River, increased their diligence and strived to attain the supreme path.

是妙光法師，奉持佛法藏，八十小劫中，廣宣法華經。

The wonderful and radiant teacher upheld the Buddhist teachings and widely proclaimed the Lotus Sutra during the period of eighty small kalpas.

是諸八王子，妙光所開化，堅固無上道，當見無數佛。

These are the eight princely sons who were converted by the wonderful and radiant one, who firmly uphold the supreme path and will see countless Buddhas.

供養諸佛已，隨順行大道，相繼得成佛，轉次而授記。

After paying homage to all the Buddhas, they followed the great path and successively attained Buddhahood and passed down their teachings in turn.

最後天中天，號曰燃燈佛，諸仙之導師，度脫無量眾。

Finally, in the heavens in the sky, the one known as the Lamp-Igniting Buddha, the teacher of the celestial immortals, will save countless beings from suffering.

是妙光法師，時有一弟子，心常懷懈怠，貪著於名利，求名利無厭，多遊族姓家，棄捨所習誦，廢忘不通利。以是因緣故，號之為求名。

Once there was a Master of Wonderful Light, who had a disciple who was often lazy and attached to fame and gain, constantly seeking fame and gain without tire, traveling to families of various clans, forsaking what he had learned to recite, and neglecting what was beneficial. Therefore, he was called "one who seeks fame."

亦行眾善業，得見無數佛，供養於諸佛，隨順行大道，具六波羅蜜，今見釋師子。

However, he still engaged in many good deeds and saw countless Buddhas, offering support to all the Buddhas, following the great path and possessing six perfections. 

其後當作佛，號名曰彌勒，廣度諸眾生，其數無有量。

Now he sees the teacher of the teachings, who was once a Buddha with the name Maitreya, who saves countless sentient beings.

彼佛滅度後，懈怠者汝是；妙光法師者，今則我身是。

After that Buddha had passed away, you were the one who was lazy. The Master of Wonderful Light is now myself.

我見燈明佛，本光瑞如此，以是知今佛，欲說法華經。

I have seen the Buddha of the Lamp's Light, whose original light was so brilliant. Therefore, I know who the current Buddha is and desire to expound the Lotus Sutra.

今相如本瑞，是諸佛方便，今佛放光明，助發實相義。

Now it is like the original brilliance, through the convenience of all the Buddhas. The current Buddha shines the light of enlightenment, to aid in the realization of the truth.

諸人今當知，合掌一心待，佛當雨法雨，充足求道者。

Now all people should understand, with hands joined and a focused mind, the Buddha will rain down the teachings and fulfill those who seek the path.

諸求三乘人，若有疑悔者，佛當為除斷，令盡無有餘。」

For those seeking the Three Vehicles, if there are any doubts or regrets, the Buddha will eliminate them, so that there is no more left.」
